Data gaps are particularly substantial and pressing for _forward-looking_ risk information. 

And where forward-looking information exists, it is largely based on (i) announced intentions, or 
(ii) scenarios for which relative likelihood information currently does not exist. Moreover,
numerous organizations have created their own scenario sets. Users of forward-looking 
information do not know how to evaluate the range of different scenarios, and which
scenarios should be given more attention, and which less attention.

> Stakeholders report the need for more forward-looking data and granular data.

> While acknowledging the need for a forward-looking perspective, stakeholders still
largely rely on metrics that are backward-looking in nature. ...Stakeholders have
pointed out that they cannot rely on such metrics alone. They also need to finance
transition and analyse the pathways to climate goals over time by also using forwardlooking metrics.

## [NGFS (2022) Final report on bridging data gaps](https://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/medias/documents/final_report_on_bridging_data_gaps.pdf)

> [Credit Rating Agencies] also reported that the biggest gaps are in the forward-looking data, which
  are essential for consistency of accounting treatments and scenario assumptions. 

> The importance of forward-looking data is stressed by the stakeholders. 

> Recommendation 3: Develop well-defined and decision-useful metrics, and methodological 
  standards. To further advance this goal, there is a need to substantially increase the 
  harmonisation of forward-looking metrics.
