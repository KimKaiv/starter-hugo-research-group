abstract: "Prediction markets use a betting-like mechanism to aggregate information from disparate
sources to produce probability forecasts that represent the collective view of participants. They
have similarities with financial markets but are designed specifically to discover information
rather than transfer assets or risks. Contracts that pay out a fixed amount if a well-defined event
occurs are traded in these markets and, under certain conditions, the price at which these event-
contracts trade can be interpreted as a probability estimate that the event will occur.

This article examines the performance of 24 prediction markets for climate-related variables
that have been run over the past five years. The predicted variables included monthly
temperature and rainfall for the U.K., an index of El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic
hurricane activity, and U.K. wheat yield. The markets had horizons of 2 to 12 months.
Invitations to participate in the markets were extended to individuals and teams with relevant
expertise. Participants did not have to pay to take part but did receive cash rewards based on
their performance. Trades were made through an automated market maker overcoming the
problems of low activity that have affected previous prediction markets for specialized topics.

The predictions of the markets were consistent with good reliability, given the resolving power
afforded by the sample size. Whether this level of reliability would persist for longer, multi-
year, horizons relevant to climate change cannot be known without running markets on such
timescales, something that we strongly advocate."
