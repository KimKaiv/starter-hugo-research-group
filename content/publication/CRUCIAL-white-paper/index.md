## Executive Summary

<br>

**_What?_**
Information markets use market-like 
mechanisms to elicit and aggregate 
information. Information markets are not 
designed to transfer ownership or risk but to 
exploit the proven ability of markets to 
discover and synthesize information. 
Information markets can solve the problems of 
aggregating diverse climate expertise and
aligning the incentives of providers. They
could become the primary mechanism for 
obtaining forward-looking expertise about 
climate-related risks.

<br>

**_Why?_**
Climate change is recognised as an important 
source of risk. Regulators now believe that 
climate-related risks pose, not only a threat to 
individual firms, but possibly to the stability of 
the financial system.
In 2017 the G20’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
published recommendations that firms should 
disclose forward-looking information about 
physical and transition climate-related risks. 
More than two thousand companies have 
voluntarily signed-up to these 
recommendations. Regulators and exchanges 
in many countries plan to make climate-related disclosures mandatory. These trends 
have created a demand for forward-looking 
information about climate, such as emissions 
pathways and changes in physical climate 
risks. Companies requiring this information 
are a nascent source of funding for applied 
climate research. They are particularly 
interested in the efficiency with which 
distributed information can be aggregated 
and communicated for use in decision making 
and risk management. 
The marketplace for climate information is 
diverse and fragmented. Relevant expertise 
exists in public agencies, academia, think 
tanks, as well as an emerging class of private 
companies known as climate service 
providers (CSPs). Given the long horizons 
involved, few providers have established track 
records, so it is difficult for users to evaluate 
their skill. Furthermore, most forecasts are 
offered with no warranty. This creates a 
situation in which bad forecasts can drive out 
good ones; a situation reminiscent of credit 
ratings for mortgage-backed securities in the 
run-up to the subprime crisis.

<br>

**_How?_**
We propose a climate information exchange 
that hosts markets predicting climate-related 
variables. These variables will include high-level ones, such as global greenhouse gas 
concentrations, and more granular ones like
sea-level rise in specific locations. Market 
participants will include individuals and 
institutions with expertise across the range of 
disciplines relevant to climate forecasting, 
including meteorology, climatology, 
economics, social sciences, and policy. 
Participants will use on-platform credits 
representing a claim on a proportion of 
research funds distributed through the 
exchange. These funds will come from public, 
private, and philanthropic sources interested 
in effective altruism.
The exchange will use AGORA, developed by 
Hivemind Technologies Ltd. AGORA has been 
used to run expert information markets for 
seasonal forecasts, El Niño events, Atlantic 
hurricane activity, and crop yields. AGORA
solves several problems that have afflicted 
previous attempts to create information 
markets for climate: an automated market 
maker guarantees liquidity allowing markets 
to function in the absence of uninformed 
“noise” traders. AGORA supports very large 
outcome spaces, enabling consensus 
probability distributions to be extracted, not 
just probabilities for binary events. 

<br>

**_Where?_**
Many of the markets will have horizons of 
more than a decade. The consensus forecasts 
generated will be a public good, to be 
distributed for free. There is a strong case for 
the exchange to be hosted by a university, 
which will become a hub for international 
climate expertise.
