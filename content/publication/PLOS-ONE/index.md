# Abstract.
abstract: "Predicting future climate requires the integration of knowledge and 
expertise from a wide range of disciplines. Predictions must account for 
climate-change mitigation policies which may depend on climate predictions. 
This interdependency, or _circularity_, means that climate predictions must 
be conditioned on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Long-range forecasts 
also suffer from information asymmetry because users cannot use track records 
to judge the skill of providers. 

The problems of aggregation, circularity, and information asymmetry can be 
addressed using prediction markets with joint-outcome spaces, allowing simultaneous 
forecasts of GHG concentrations and temperature. The viability of prediction markets 
with highly granular, joint-outcome spaces was tested with markets for monthly UK 
rainfall and temperature. The experiments demonstrate these markets can aggregate 
the judgments of experts with relevant expertise, and suggest similarly structured 
markets, with longer horizons, could provide a mechanism to produce credible forecasts 
of climate-related risks for policy making, planning, and risk disclosure."
