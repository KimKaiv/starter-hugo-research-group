# Abstract.
abstract: "Before the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season began the consensus was that it would be
one of the most active seasons in history. However, a prolonged quiet period during 
late August and early September possibly led forecasters to question these
predictions, before later activity fulfilled the season’s high expectations. 

The CRUCIAL initiative ran a “prediction market” during 2024 which allowed experts 
to bet on the number of hurricanes. Prices in this market provide an insight into how 
views changed during the season.

Prediction markets can efficiently aggregate the judgements of multiple experts and 
provide more up-to-date information than periodically issued forecasts."
