summary: "In this talk, Todd Kaplan (UoExeter, UoHaifa, CRUCIAL) presents joint work with 
[Lawrence Choo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawrence-choo-8236501a/) and 
[Ro'i Zultan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B6Fz5HMAAAAJ&hl=en) 
on the effect that the presence of manipulators has on trust in prediction markets."


abstract: 'When it is common knowledge that there are no manipulators, the prediction market 
correctly identifies the true state of the world. If participants are told that 
manipulators _may be present_, the volatility of prediction market prices increases. If the suspicion
is unfounded, the market can still identify the true state. Unfortunately if 
manipulators _are present_, it is harder for the market to identify the correct 
answer. When there are manipulators, managers under-utilize the information 
revealed in prices. Furthermore, mere suspicion of manipulation erodes trust in 
the market, leading to the implementation of suboptimal policies --- even if 
actual manipulation is absent.'
