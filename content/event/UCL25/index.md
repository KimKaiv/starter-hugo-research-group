 _Modeling for Decision Making_ project led by [Erica Thompson](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/66106) 
assembled an inter- and trans-disciplinary group of researchers with interests at 
the intersection of climate modelling and the financial sector for a two-day workshop 
on _Climate, Models, and Finance_ that was conducted under Chatham House Rules. 
<br><br>
Day 1 (Sept 4) featured 11 presentations from a combination of academic, public-body, 
and private-sector experts and researchers. 
<br><br>
Day 2 (Sept 5) featured a round-table discussion to tease out the key insights, 
lessons, and opportunities opened up by previous day's presentations and the 
people and institutions present.
<br><br>
CRUCIAL's presentation on Day 1 was given by Mark Roulston, and Kim Kaivanto
represented CRUCIAL and Lancaster University in the round-table on Day 2.
