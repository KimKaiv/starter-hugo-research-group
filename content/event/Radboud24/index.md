summary: "Kim Kaivanto on the properties and potential of CRUCIAL's LMSR platform at the inaugural
 *Experimental Sustainable Finance* symposium hosted by Radboud University."

abstract: "CRUCIAL's prediction market platform implements the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) 
automated market maker (Hanson 2003), which mitigates the principal challenges facing the user-pays Climate 
Service Provider (CSP) sector: incentives, abundance of methodological & procedural choice, need for 
multi-disciplinarity, and 'circularity'. The platform has been used successfully for hosting 24 
climate-related markets with maturities ranging from 2 to 12 months. This sample of markets perform 
well in terms of probabilistic calibration and information-add over historical climatological benchmarks. 
Moreover, a subset of these markets implemented a 'joint-outcome market' structure, which embeds a spectrum of
conditional forecasts. This subsample demonstrates the viability of running joint-outcome markets with 
CRUCIAL's LMSR platform despite the large outcome space (5,207 distinct partitions) and the complexity 
that this and the two-dimensional structure poses for participants. Both the hard data generated by these
markets (price and volume series) as well as qualitative feedback from participants indicate that the markets
were well-behaved and the participants were able to adapt quickly to the joint-outcome market structure as
a mechanism for expressing their expertise."
