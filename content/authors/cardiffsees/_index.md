The Cardiff team brings together diverse expertise on climate change processes 
and their consequences within the Earth system. Research spans timescales from 
the distant past to near-term hazard warnings and far into the future, addressing 
impacts of climate on hazards (e.g., floods and droughts), water availability to 
humans and plants, air pollution, vegetation (and crop) health, and more. Led 
from the [School of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth-environmental-sciences), 
the team employs field research, palaeoclimate records, numerical modelling, 
and data analysis to explore interactions within the Earth system and the dynamics 
of our changing climate.
