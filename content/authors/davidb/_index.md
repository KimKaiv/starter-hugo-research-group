David runs Fore Stun Ltd, a software engineering consultancy, working on bespoke projects.

Previously, as first engineering hire at a technology company servicing hedge fund traders, 
he saw a diverse range of market behaviour and technical mistakes (and opportunities). He 
studied and taught chemical engineering at the University of Cambridge and has a PhD in 
Biotechnology from the same university. He is currently working on an outreach project 
on professional ethics.
