This team is composed of experts from the 
[University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/atoc/) and the 
[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa](https://www2.hawaii.edu/~ckaramp/), 
combines deep knowledge in ENSO prediction using both dynamical models and machine 
learning techniques. Their research has made significant strides in enhancing the 
scientific understanding of the dynamics behind extreme El Niño events and prolonged 
La Niña episodes. These advancements have been translated into a powerful suite of 
predictive tools designed specifically to forecast disruptive ENSO events.  A key 
achievement of their work was the successful prediction of the second-year La Niña 
of 2017--2018, which was closely linked to the exceptionally active and costly 2017 
Atlantic hurricane season. Their models have demonstrated a strong ability to reduce 
false positives --- one of the persistent challenges in operational forecasting models. 
These results underscore the real-world applicability and accuracy of these predictive 
approaches.
