The team is based in the [Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/atmospheric-oceanic-and-planetary-physics/research-groups) 
Sub-Department of The University of Oxford and is led by [Dr. Kristian Strommen](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/strommen). 
The group consists primarily of members working on 
questions of predictability on timescales ranging from short-term weather to decades ahead, 
with a particular focus on the quantification of uncertainty and probabilistic information. 
The expertise of the group includes how global warming affects the risk of extreme weather; 
mid-latitude predictability on seasonal-to-decadal timescales; tropical/extratropical 
teleconnections; machine learning; and applications of weather forecasts to the energy 
industry. The group members follow a research paradigm wherein information is drawn 
seamlessly together across multiple timescales, using numerical weather forecasts on 
one end and climate models on the other.
