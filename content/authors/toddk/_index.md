# Profile text from below the "---"
# Notes:
# I welcome and maintain research collaborations across disciplinary boundaries, ranging from computer science to philosphy of science, from psychology to mathematics. 
# I have worked on a diverse range of research and consultancy projects, including such special topics such as investor sentiment, security behaviour, civil aerospace R&D support schemes, air transport CO2 emissions, venture capital, the exploitation of social science research, and airport slot allocation rulings.
