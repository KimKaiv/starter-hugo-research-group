The purpose of the CRUCIAL Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) is to provide advice
on the topic of markets and the choice of data used to settle them as well as to 
serve as arbitrators should any ambiguity or dispute arise concerning the settlement 
of a market. The SAC or its individual members may provide, where appropriate, 
other independent scientific advice: e.g., regarding methodology, experimental design, and data analysis. 
The SAC or its individual members may also review scientific publications produced by CRUCIAL.
