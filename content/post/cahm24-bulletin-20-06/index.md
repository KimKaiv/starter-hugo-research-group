of more than 10 hurricanes has decreased in the last week from 44% to 37% while the 
chances of more than 12 hurricanes remains unchanged at 18%. The chances that the

## Weatherbug on June’s hurricane history

Weatherbug points out that historically June is not an 
active month for hurricanes and, “*Since modern weather 
records began, nearly half of all the Junes do not see any 
named storms.*”[^1]
