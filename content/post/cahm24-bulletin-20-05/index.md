**The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1. This season is predicted to one of, if not the most, active on record.**

The implied probability, according to prices in the 
CAHM24 expert prediction market, of more than 10 
hurricanes has increased in the last week from 35\% 
to 44\% while the chances of more than 12 
hurricanes has doubled from 9\% to 18\%. The 
chances that the record of 15 hurricanes set in 2005 
will be equaled or exceeded has also ticked up to 
4.5\%.

## Manifold Markets

Manifold Markets is running a play-money prediction 
market for the number of hurricanes in 2024.[^1] Its modal 
prediction is for around 11 or 12 hurricanes, but it suffers 
from an "overround", with implied probabilities across all 
outcomes summing to over 200\%. This is a problem seen in 
markets that lack arbitrageurs or a well-designed 
automated market maker.
