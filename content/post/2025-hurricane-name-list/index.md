As each Atlantic tropical storm forms in 2025, it is alotted the next available name from the following list:

Should there be more than 21 Atlantic tropical storms in the 2025 season, additional names will be drawn from a reserve list.

The World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee maintains six different lists of names, which are used in rotation 
and thus repeat every six years. Accordingly, the 2025 list was last used in 2019.[^1] 
To reflect the geographical spread of Atlantic and Caribbean storms, the names are drawn in a balanced manner from English, 
French, and Spanish. 
Furthermore, the names alternate by gender, and are selected to be respectful of societal sensitivities. 

According to data supplied by [NOAA National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/), each season between 
1991 and 2020 produced  14 named tropical storms on average. 
Of the tropical storms, on average 7 developed into hurricanes (tropical cyclones with sustained winds of at least 64 knots). 

For details on how tropical storms are classified, see the post [Tropical Cyclones vs. Hurricanes vs. Major Hurricanes](/post/hurricane-intensity-scale/)
