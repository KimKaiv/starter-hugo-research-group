**The corporate foundation of the French reinsurance giant SCOR is backing an initiative led 
by Lancaster University Management School to use prediction markets to combine diverse 
forecasts of future climate into unified predictions and potentially provide a radical new 
mechanism for funding climate research.**

The Climate Risk and Uncertainty Collective Intelligence Laboratory (CRUCIAL) is a collaboration 
between researchers at Lancaster University Management School (LUMS) and the University of 
Exeter’s Land, Environment, Economics and Policy Institute (LEEP). CRUCIAL uses prediction 
markets, with expert participants from academia and the private sector, to produce collective 
forecasts of climate-related risks. 

CRUCIAL runs "prediction markets" in which climate experts effectively bet on possible future 
climate outcomes. CRUCIAL's platform is designed to turn their bets into probabilities of the 
different possible outcomes. These probabilities represent the collective wisdom of the 
participating experts, which can change as new information becomes available to those taking 
part. This approach to producing forecasts of future climate means that users of the forecasts 
don't have to pick a single forecaster to rely on, and it lets forecasters demonstrate how confident 
they are in their own predictions. 

Participants in CRUCIAL's markets do not have to pay to take part but are compensated based on 
the contributions they make to the accuracy of the collective forecasts. While participants might 
base their predictions on different types of models — including AI as well as more traditional 
climate models — a prediction market can aggregate all these views into a single collective 
forecast. Such markets could provide a new performance-based way to fund climate forecasting 
research and provide forecasts of global temperatures, greenhouse gas concentrations, sealevel rise, hurricane activity and other climate-related risks.
CRUCIAL uses the AGORA prediction market platform, developed by Winton Capital 
Management, for climate forecasting. Winton donated AGORA to Lancaster University, where 
CRUCIAL is currently running a demonstration market to predict the number of hurricanes during 
the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. 

The SCOR Corporate Foundation for Science was created by the French reinsurer SCOR to 
support research in risk analysis of interest to the reinsurance industry. The Foundation will 
provide funding to CRUCIAL to support its infrastructure and personnel and funds to incentivize 
participants in the prediction markets.

Dr. Kim Kaivanto, who is leading the initiative at Lancaster University Management School, said 
that "Our ambition is to create a new type of scientific institution that combines the concept of 
incentive prizes — like the X-Prize — with the proven ability of markets to elicit and aggregate 
information."

According to Dr. Mark Roulston, who led the development of AGORA at Winton, "When the 
primary deliverable of research is a forecast, prediction markets offer a more effective way to 
combine and summarize the research and a more efficient way to distribute funding."

Highlighting the interest for a reinsurer like SCOR to participate in the CRUCIAL project, Philippe 
Trainar, director of the SCOR Foundation for Science, insists on the fact that "The consequences 
of climate change are currently and will remain in the future the subject of lively controversy 
between experts" and that "prediction markets have demonstrated their unrivaled capacity to anticipate 
future trends in such controversial areas, where it is necessary to quickly combine scientific results, 
statistical observations and learning from experience."

The SCOR Corporate Foundation for Science forms part of the SCOR reinsurance group's long-term 
commitment to research and the dissemination of risk-related knowledge. This 
commitment is an integral part of SCOR’s DNA, as illustrated by the Group’s tagline, "The Art \& 
Science of Risk". Risk is the “raw material” of reinsurance, and SCOR stays at the cutting edge of 
risk expertise and research through its vast network of academic institutions, as well as through 
the support it provides to numerous disciplines including mathematics, actuarial science, 
physics, chemistry, geophysics, climatology, economics, finance, and more.
