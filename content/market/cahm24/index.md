CRUCIAL Atlantic Hurricane Market 2024 (CAHM24) launched on Dec 11, 2023, and ran 
until the end of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. This market was designed to predict 
the number of Atlantic hurricanes occurring during the 2024 Atlantic surricane season 
(June 1st through to November 30th). 

The CAHM24 market was closed at midnight on November 30th, by which time [11 hurricanes were
recorded](/post/cahm24-season-so-far/). Unless fresh data or analysis comes to light that causes
the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) to revise this count, outstanding CAHM24 contracts on the 
outcome '11' will pay out 1 credit. 

The CAHM24 organisers are observing NHC reports. As long as there are no indications of 
possible reclassification, outstanding CAHM24 contracts will be resolved in 1 week (December 9th 2024).
