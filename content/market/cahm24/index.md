CRUCIAL Atlantic Hurricane Market 2024 (CAHM24) launched on Dec 11, 2023, and ran 
until the end of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. This market was designed to predict 
the number of Atlantic hurricanes occurring during the 2024 Atlantic surricane season 
(June 1st through to November 30th). 

During the season 18 named storms occurred and [11 of these attained hurricane strength](/post/cahm24-season-so-far/). 
Over Â£6,000 will be paid out to the experts that took part in the market.
