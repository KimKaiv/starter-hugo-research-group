## Many planning, policy, and investment decisions require high-quality information on 
## the risks and uncertainties of future climate change. While there are many relevant 
## sources of information and expertise, decision makers face significant difficulties 
## in accessing, interpreting, and appraising such information.

## Our approach recognises the multiple challenges currently affecting the provision of 
## climate-risk information: adverse incentives, abundance of methodological choice, 
## the need for a level playing field among a diverse range of scientific and social-
## scientific disciplines, the circularity problem in unconditional forecasts, and 
## persistent data gaps.

AGORA is a platform for hosting sophisticated prediction markets that can aggregate the output of quantitative predictive models alongside more tacit forms of expert knowledge. AGORA was originally created by the investment manager Winton Group before being further developed by its technology spinout, Hivemind. 

AGORA supports markets that generate high-resolution joint probability distributions from the trading activity of participants, who can use the AGORA UI or trade programmatically using an API.

AGORA has been tested over the past three years and used to run prediction markets with expert participants for forecasting seasonal temperatures and rainfall, Atlantic hurricane activity, and El Ni√±o events. 
Hivemind transferred the IP for AGORA to Lancaster University in 2022 for use in CRUCIAL.
