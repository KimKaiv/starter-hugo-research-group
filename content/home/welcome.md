##
## Many planning, policy, and investment decisions require high-quality information on 
## the risks and uncertainties of future climate change. While there are many relevant 
## sources of information and expertise, decision makers face significant difficulties 
## in accessing, interpreting, and appraising such information.

## Our approach recognises the multiple challenges currently affecting the provision of 
## climate-risk information: adverse incentives, abundance of methodological choice, 
## the need for a level playing field among a diverse range of scientific and social-
## scientific disciplines, the circularity problem in unconditional forecasts, and 
## persistent data gaps.

## CRUCIAL's mission is to deliver calibrated, high-quality climate-risk forecasts.

<br>

## We employ *expert prediction markets* -- hosted on the AGORA prediction-market platform -- to elicit, aggregate, and summarise knowledge on future climate risks, drawing on expertise from diverse areas of physical, social, and policy science.
