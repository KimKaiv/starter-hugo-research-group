      <description>&lt;p&gt;Top emitters have a large influence on the annual rate of GHG emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 4 emitters &amp;ndash; China, the USA, India, and Russia &amp;ndash; account for 55% of
annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/carbon-footprint-by-country&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These country emissions are antropogenic and exogenous to physical-science based climate modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop an undertanding of the anthropogenic contribution to future CO2 concentrations,
there is a need for &lt;em&gt;country specialists&lt;/em&gt; in the politics, energy policies, environmental
regulations, and economics of each substantial emitter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abundance of Choice</title>
      <link>https://CRUCIALab.net/challenge/abundance-of-choice/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 17:28:43 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Complex statistical analysis and mathematical modelling involve multitudes of
choices and assumptions. Recent &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;many analysts, one data set&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; studies show the
danger of relying solely on one research team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present several examples from this literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;h2 id=&#34;silberzahn-et-al-2018httpsjournalssagepubcomdoiabs1011772515245917747646-----social-science-psychology&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2515245917747646&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Silberzahn et al. (2018)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; social science, psychology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same
research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to
dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. &amp;hellip;Twenty teams (69%) found a
statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant
relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates.
&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip;significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult
to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed results from analyzing a complex data set
can be highly contingent on justifiable, but subjective,
analytic decisions. Uncertainty in interpreting research
results is therefore not just a function of statistical power
or the use of questionable research practices; it is also
a function of the many reasonable decisions that
researchers must make in order to conduct the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

(2021)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; economics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These researchers ask whether two published empirical studies reporting causal
empirical results replicate when this is attempted by multiple research teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black et al. (2008) Staying in the classroom and out of the maternity ward?
The effect of compulsory schooling laws on teenage births. &lt;em&gt;The Economic Journal&lt;/em&gt;,
118(530): 1025&amp;ndash;1054. &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/118/530/1025/5089485&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairlie et al. (2011) Is employer-based health insurance a barrier to entrepreneurship?
&lt;em&gt;Journal of Health Economics&lt;/em&gt;, 30(1): 146&amp;ndash;162. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WR637-1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruit 49 published researchers to participate in replication teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attrition (due to a short completion window), they obtained 7 independent
replications of each study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers make hundreds of decisions about data collection, preparation, and
analysis in their research. &amp;hellip;We find large differences in data preparation and analysis
decisions, many of which would not likely be reported in a publication. No two
replicators reported the same sample size. Statistical significance varied across
replications, and for one of the studies the effect&amp;rsquo;s sign varied as well. &lt;em&gt;The
standard deviation of estimates across replications was 3&amp;ndash;4 times the mean reported
standard error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These authors settle on the research question: &lt;em&gt;does immigration reduce support for
social policies among the public&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruited 162 participants across 73 teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each team was provided with a database of answers to a 6-question module on the
role of government in providing different social services, which is part of the
long-running International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). They were also provided
with a wide range of World Bank, OECD, and immigration data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;major research steps explain at most 2.6% of total variance in effect sizes and
10% of the deviance in subjective conclusions. Expertise, prior beliefs and attitudes
explain even less. &lt;em&gt;Each generated model was unique, which points to a vast universe
of research design variability normally hidden from view&lt;/em&gt; in the presentation, consumption,
and perhaps even creation of scientific results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;h2 id=&#34;synopsis&#34;&gt;Synopsis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies have explicit selection criteria to ensure that they recruit only competent
researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to studies of this nature, the &amp;ldquo;degrees of freedom&amp;rdquo; inherent in empirical
analysis were not fully appreciated by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than abundance of choice, these studies reveal a vast universe of previously hidden
research-design and analysis-operationalisation variability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unconditional forecasts of global temperature alone have an ambiguous interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a forecast portends a small global temperature anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are future temperatures low because CO2 emissions will be tamed aggressively, or
because climate turns out to be much less sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations
than currently believed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictions of e.g. global temperature alone lack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the pathway of the policy variable (CO2 concentration), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the relationship between the policy variable and the outcome variable (global temperature).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In monetary policy, the relationship between interest rates (the policy variable)
and inflation and the output gap (the targets of policy) is known as the &amp;lsquo;Taylor rule&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &amp;lsquo;Taylor rule&amp;rsquo; for emissions policy over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not for one country, and certaintly not across all top emitters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the net Zero commitment formally moves toward this, but statements of intention
do not necessarily translate into operational, enforced regulations in all countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can climate-risk information providers resolve this circularity problem?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data gaps</title>
      <link>https://CRUCIALab.net/challenge/data-gaps/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 17:00:43 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://CRUCIALab.net/challenge/data-gaps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data gaps are particularly substantial and pressing for &lt;em&gt;forward-looking&lt;/em&gt; risk information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And where forward-looking information exists, it is largely based on (i) announced intentions, or
(b) scenarios for which there currently exists no relative likelihood information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ngfs-2021-progress-report-on-bridging-data-gapshttpswwwngfsnetsitesdefaultfilesmediasdocumentsprogress_report_on_bridging_data_gapspdf&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/medias/documents/progress_report_on_bridging_data_gaps.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NGFS (2021) Progress report on bridging data gaps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders report the need for more forward-looking data and granular data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the need for a forward-looking perspective, stakeholders still
largely rely on metrics that are backward-looking in nature. &amp;hellip;Stakeholders have
pointed out that they cannot rely on such metrics alone. They also need to finance
transition and analyse the pathways to climate goals over time by also using forwardlooking metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ngfs-2022-final-report-on-bridging-data-gapshttpswwwngfsnetsitesdefaultfilesmediasdocumentsfinal_report_on_bridging_data_gapspdf&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/medias/documents/final_report_on_bridging_data_gaps.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NGFS (2022) Final report on bridging data gaps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Credit Rating Agencies] also reported that the biggest gaps are in the forward-looking data, which
are essential for consistency of accounting treatments and scenario assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of forward-looking data is stressed by the stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendation 3: Develop well-defined and decision-useful metrics, and methodological
standards. To further advance this goal, there is a need to substantially increase the
harmonisation of forward-looking metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Bad Incentives</title>
      <link>https://CRUCIALab.net/challenge/bad-incentives/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 13:27:43 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://CRUCIALab.net/challenge/bad-incentives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Climate Service Provider&lt;/em&gt; (CSP) industry is growing rapidly to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this drive to meet growing demand, a number of issues rooted in adverse incentives have been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #1:&lt;/strong&gt; Price competition, asymmetric information, and multi-decadal &amp;lsquo;discovery time&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In many ways, the marketplace is operating on blind faith in model validation and the
professional competence in applying those models,” with some, “products and services
that may be operating outside of the bounds of scientific merit” (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay8442&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Keenan, 2019, &amp;ldquo;A climate
intelligence arms race in financial markets&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If providers of climate forecasts are paid upfront irrespective of accuracy, you don’t need to
be an economist to spot the problem with that arrangement.” &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/news/how-prediction-markets-could-improve-climate-risk-policies-and-investment-decisions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mark Roulston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2:&lt;/strong&gt; Possibility of &amp;lsquo;results-led&amp;rsquo; research. Parallels with Credit-Rating Agencies pre-2007!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #3:&lt;/strong&gt; The &amp;lsquo;public good&amp;rsquo; nature of much climate-risk information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If privately funded: how to restrict access (to private-good or club-good status) so that
individual organisations can benefit from funding the development of climate-risk information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If publicly funded: how to fund this very applied type of research, in the required
frequency of updates, when the output isn’t in the form of a piece of work suitable for a
high-ranked academic journal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #4:&lt;/strong&gt; The &amp;lsquo;downscaling&amp;rsquo; from global models is more questionable on multi-decadal horizons of
climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prcisions vs. accuracy, and &amp;lsquo;false precision&amp;rsquo;. For box-ticking exercises low accuracy might not matter.
But for informing societally transformative policies, regulations, and business-investment decisions,
false precision and low accuracy are fundamentally problematic in their consequences: misallocation of effort, resource, and painful sacrifice (which is on the horizon).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRUCIAL White Paper</title>
      <link>https://CRUCIALab.net/publication/crucial-white-paper/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:01:26 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://CRUCIALab.net/publication/crucial-white-paper/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Information markets use market-like 
mechanisms to elicit and aggregate 
information. Information markets are not 
designed to transfer ownership or risk but to 
exploit the proven ability of markets to 
discover and synthesize information. 
Information markets can solve the problems of 
aggregating diverse climate expertise and
aligning the incentives of providers. They
could become the primary mechanism for 
obtaining forward-looking expertise about 
climate-related risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Climate change is recognised as an important 
source of risk. Regulators now believe that 
climate-related risks pose, not only a threat to 
individual firms, but possibly to the stability of 
the financial system.
In 2017 the G20’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
published recommendations that firms should 
disclose forward-looking information about 
physical and transition climate-related risks. 
More than two thousand companies have 
voluntarily signed-up to these 
recommendations. Regulators and exchanges 
in many countries plan to make climate-related disclosures mandatory. These trends 
have created a demand for forward-looking 
information about climate, such as emissions 
pathways and changes in physical climate 
risks. Companies requiring this information 
are a nascent source of funding for applied 
climate research. They are particularly 
interested in the efficiency with which 
distributed information can be aggregated 
and communicated for use in decision making 
and risk management. 
The marketplace for climate information is 
diverse and fragmented. Relevant expertise 
exists in public agencies, academia, think 
tanks, as well as an emerging class of private 
companies known as climate service 
providers (CSPs). Given the long horizons 
involved, few providers have established track 
records, so it is difficult for users to evaluate 
their skill. Furthermore, most forecasts are 
offered with no warranty. This creates a 
situation in which bad forecasts can drive out 
good ones; a situation reminiscent of credit 
ratings for mortgage-backed securities in the 
run-up to the subprime crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
We propose a climate information exchange 
that hosts markets predicting climate-related 
variables. These variables will include high-level ones, such as global greenhouse gas 
concentrations, and more granular ones like
sea-level rise in specific locations. Market 
participants will include individuals and 
institutions with expertise across the range of 
disciplines relevant to climate forecasting, 
including meteorology, climatology, 
economics, social sciences, and policy. 
Participants will use on-platform credits 
representing a claim on a proportion of 
research funds distributed through the 
exchange. These funds will come from public, 
private, and philanthropic sources interested 
in effective altruism.
The exchange will use AGORA, developed by 
Hivemind Technologies Ltd. AGORA has been 
used to run expert information markets for 
seasonal forecasts, El Niño events, Atlantic 
hurricane activity, and crop yields. AGORA
solves several problems that have afflicted 
previous attempts to create information 
markets for climate: an automated market 
maker guarantees liquidity allowing markets 
to function in the absence of uninformed 
“noise” traders. AGORA supports very large 
outcome spaces, enabling consensus 
probability distributions to be extracted, not 
just probabilities for binary events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Many of the markets will have horizons of 
more than a decade. The consensus forecasts 
generated will be a public good, to be 
distributed for free. There is a strong case for 
the exchange to be hosted by a university, 
which will become a hub for international 
climate expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why no climate warranties?</title>
      <link>https://CRUCIALab.net/post/why-no-climate-warranties/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 18:41:05 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://CRUCIALab.net/post/why-no-climate-warranties/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The market for climate risk forecasts suffers from a problem economists call 
“asymmetric information”: the sellers of forecasts probably know more about their 
accuracy than the buyers. A short or medium range weather forecast can be verified 
in a couple of weeks, and reasonable statistics about their accuracy can be 
accumulated in a matter of months but, because a climate forecast might not verify 
for years or decades, buyers cannot usually use a forecaster’s track record to assess 
their accuracy. A market in which the quality of a product won’t be apparent for years 
is susceptible to “adverse selection”, which is economists’ way of saying it will be 
a magnet for charlatans. This creates a challenge for providers of climate forecasts 
who are competent and have invested in research and development to improve the accuracy: 
how can they persuade buyers that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are not charlatans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Talk is cheap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate service providers can emphasise their credentials and highlight the scientific 
effort that goes into their products; they might allow users to see how their models 
work &amp;mdash; although many users don’t have the expertise to assess the models, and if the 
seller uses proprietary models this might not be option anyway. The problem with these 
solutions is that “talk is cheap”, and it is difficult for a buyer to distinguish 
authentic expertise from slick marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economist George Akerlof, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on information 
asymmetries, explained the problem in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1879431&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;classic paper published in 1970&lt;/a&gt; which 
described the market for used cars. As with climate forecasts, it is difficult 
for the buyer of a used car to know its quality and, also like climate forecasts, 
a car is an infrequent purchase so there is little opportunity to accumulate much 
first-hand knowledge about the reliability of a seller. These attributes made the 
market for used cars attractive to less-than-reputable characters, creating the 
stereotype of the untrustworthy used-car dealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dealers offered warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reputation of used-car dealers has improved since the 1970s, partly because 
the sector adopted one of the strategies for dealing with asymmetric information 
described by Akerlof: offering cash back warranties. In the U.K. used-car 
warranties became mandatory in 2015, but even before then, dealers offered 
warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors and enable them to 
charge higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promise of a refund if a product fails can serve two distinct purposes: 
indemnifying the buyer for losses caused by the failure and providing a credible 
signal that the seller believes failure is unlikely. An inaccurate climate 
forecast may cause the user a loss far above the price they paid for the forecast: 
for example, they may build sea defences that are too low, or too high. While a 
forecast provider might not be able to indemnify the user against all costs, 
they can still offer a refund to signal their confidence in the accuracy of the 
forecast. The credibility of the signal is determined, not by whether the refund 
will compensate the user, but whether it will be painful for the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate forecasts, generally, are not categorically right or wrong: they are 
probabilistic forecasts — or they should be — in which probabilities are assigned 
to specified outcomes. How could the terms of a refund be structured for this type 
of product? There is a literature on this subject going back 70 years, when &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/78/1/1520-0493_1950_078_0001_vofeit_2_0_co_2.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Glenn 
Brier introduced a quadratic scoring rule for assessing probability forecasts&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984087&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I.J. Good suggested the logarithmic scoring rule as a way to reward forecasters.&lt;/a&gt; 
Since then more work has been done on the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/Gneiting2007jasa.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“proper scoring rules”&lt;/a&gt; for 
incentivizing forecasters. More recently, proper scoring rules have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/43189651&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;suggested 
as the basis for incentives that screen the views of informed and uninformed experts 
when only a single forecast is being made.&lt;/a&gt; There are subtleties to be appreciated, 
and pitfalls to avoid, but in principle a proper scoring rule could be used to 
evaluate the quality of a probabilistic forecast and determine the refund to which 
the buyer is entitled. This can only be done when the actual outcome becomes known, 
which in some cases may be more than twenty years after the forecast is made. Some 
people might think that providing a warranty on a timescale of decades is 
unrealistic but other industries do it: e.g., 10-year structural warranties for 
new houses or the lifetime warranties offered by high-end manufacturers that can 
be claimed decades after a product is purchased. It is also analogous to deferring 
bonuses in the finance industry. Climate service providers unwilling to expose 
themselves to some risk on climatic timescales are arguably in the wrong business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A well-structured warranty can be used to communicate how much confidence a forecast provider has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information asymmetry in the market for climate forecasts is at least as bad 
as the one for used cars, so why aren’t warranties commonplace? There is no need 
for a regulator to force forecasters to provide warranties. As with used-cars, 
any provider is free to unilaterally offer warranties to differentiate themselves. 
One possibility is that few climate service providers have enough confidence in 
their forecasts to give warranties. However, a probabilistic forecast combined 
with a well-structured warranty can be used to communicate how much (or little) 
confidence a forecast provider has, and this is information that the forecast user 
should want. An alternative explanation is that there is little demand from buyers 
for sellers to provide a credible signal of their confidence in forecast accuracy. 
This interpretation is consistent with the view that buyers of climate risk 
information use it to satisfy regulators, auditors, or other stakeholders, but 
aren’t really worried about its accuracy; they just need it to give them “plausible 
deniability”. Worse than indifference, is the possibility that some organisations 
&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; inaccurate forecasts. Back in the early 2000s, the issuers of mortgage-backed 
securities didn’t want accurate credit ratings for them, they wanted top-notch 
ratings, even if these did not reflect the true risk of default. These issuers would 
play rating agencies off against each other to get their desired ratings, and the 
ensuing proliferation of mis-rated securities contributed to the subprime crisis of 
2007/08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-users of climate risk forecasts who care about accuracy should signal their 
commitment by being prepared to pay more for forecasts that come with a warranty. 
This will motivate reputable providers to offer such guarantees, thus differentiating 
themselves from less able providers. Without a strategy to combat asymmetric 
information about climate forecasts it is possible that climate service providers 
will gradually acquire the reputation of 1970s used-car dealers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;industry-and-academic-leaders-come-together-for-climate-risk-workshop&#34;&gt;Industry and academic leaders come together for climate risk workshop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An event co-organised by a Lancaster University Management School economist brought industry and academic figures together to discuss the links between investment strategies and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Kim Kaivanto (Economics) was part of the team behind the Workshop on Prediction Markets for Climate Risk, held at Woburn House, in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers and academics with expertise in market mechanisms and climate risk from Lancaster University, Oxford University, the University of Exeter, Imperial College London, the University of Reading and the London School of Economics attended the event online and in-person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were joined by representatives of organisations concerned about the accuracy of the climate information they use for decision making, risk management and risk disclosure. These included Aviva, Gallagher Re, Axa XL, BNP Paribas, Premetrica, Economics for the Environment Consultancy, National Bank of Belgium, Weather Logistics Ltd., Global Assoc Risk Professionals, Insight Investment, APG Asset Management, Jupiter Intelligence, Federated Hermes, and Smarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Kaivanto said: “Many planning and investment decisions require an understanding of how future climate change will manifest itself. There are many sources of information and expertise, but decision-makers face significant difficulties in accessing, interpreting, and appraising it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This workshop provided the opportunity for academia and finance professionals to discuss how we can establish a UK-based prediction market exchange that will seek to deliver robust and publicly available climate forecasts. It could serve as a mechanism to fund research that targets the highest priority climate risks of sponsoring institutions in an incentive compatible way for providers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his presentation at Woburn House, Dr Kaivanto outlined structural issues with the climate risk information and forecast markets, including how the decadal “discovery times” required to ascertain the accuracy of climate forecasts creates an information asymmetry in which providers are likely to know more about the quality of the forecasts than users. This asymmetry makes the market vulnerable to adverse selection in which low-quality forecasts drive out higher-quality forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also discussed the potential risks of relying on single models and providers for climate risk assessment, and the circularity problem in climate prediction, and how it might be solved by allowing forecasters to make predictions of climate conditioned on greenhouse gas concentrations, which is possible using two-dimensional, joint-outcome markets (e.g. CO2 concentration and global temperature anomaly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session concluded that participants in prediction markets should be seen as sources of information who are rewarded for impounding their information into prediction market prices, not as sources of revenue for the market maker, or for better-informed or quicker market participants. Selection of participants – potentially restricted to individuals or organisations (academic, private sector or NGOs) – would allow for a diverse and credible pool of expertise, adding to the credibility of the markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also concluded that the information the markets would generate would have the attributes of a ‘public good’: non-rival and non-excludable, with funding typically from governments, philanthropic foundations, or consortia of end-users – the latter of whom could limit access to the information, for more of a ‘club good’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1970, the economist George Akerlof published what would become a classic paper called, 
“&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1879431&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and Market Mechanisms.&lt;/a&gt;” The “lemons” he was 
referring to were low-quality used cars. His insight was that, in markets where buyers 
cannot evaluate products, they will not pay a premium for purported high quality. This, 
in turn, will give sellers little incentive to provide high quality products. Consequently, 
the average quality of products in the market declines, further reducing the amount buyers 
are willing to pay. In economics jargon an “information asymmetry” between buyers and sellers 
results in “adverse selection”. The process identified by Akerlof is now a textbook example 
of market failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The used car market is not the only one susceptible to the “lemon” problem. (Ironically, in the market for actual lemons, buyers can easily assess freshness and taste). A rapidly growing market that is also vulnerable is the one for information about long-range climate risks. A buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them. They just need to know some statistics and be able to collect a sufficiently large sample of forecasts and subsequent outcomes to estimate the skill of the provider. For forecasts 1–2 days ahead, this sample might be obtained in a matter of months. However, companies increasingly need forecasts of climate-related risks on horizons of years, and even decades. Obviously, on these time scales, waiting to see how forecasts turn out before choosing a provider is not practical. Some providers want to keep their models and methods proprietary, but even with full transparency it can be hard for non-specialists to judge their quality. When a market has these characteristics, buyers need to be alert to the danger that bad products will crowd out good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are theoretical reasons why the quality of climate information may deteriorate, but is 
there evidence of this happening in practice? In 2019, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay8442&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;article in Science&lt;/a&gt; suggested that 
some climate information products might be “&amp;hellip;operating outside of the bounds of scientific merit” 
and, if you work in the field of climate risk, you have probably heard stories of providers 
pushing precision and granularity beyond what is scientifically plausible. But is there systematic 
evidence that some climate information has a lemon flavour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortcomings in long-range climate-related predictions might not become apparent for years but there are already indications of problems. Hain et al. recently looked at six different metrics of firm-level exposure to physical climate risks. Three of the measures, from TruCost (part of S&amp;amp;P), Carbon4 Finance and South Pole, were based on the output of climate models, while the other three, from Truvalue Labs (part of FactSet) and two academic groups were constructed by analysing the content of social media, earnings calls and 10-K filings. The correlations between the metrics were generally low, both overall and within specific sectors. Indeed, after allowing for the multiplicity of correlations tested, there were arguably no significant correlations between different metrics. Think about this for a moment: six metrics all claiming to measure the same thing, or at least to be proxies for the same thing, yet they don’t correlate with each other. Even the most generous interpretation implies that most of the metrics contain little information about the common factor they claim to measure. Perhaps one of the metrics is a good measure, but which one? Perhaps none of the metrics are informative. Consider an analogy in which there are six different blood tests to measure the same substance, but when hundreds of subjects are given all six tests there is no correlation between the results. Would a doctor base clinical decisions on any of these tests? Would a medical regulator allow such a situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the accuracy becomes apparent all those involved are likely to have moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of information asymmetry between buyers and sellers might be compounded when the buyers of climate information are not concerned with the accuracy of the information either. Much of the demand for forward-looking climate information is driven by regulators and shareholders expecting firms to disclose their climate-related risks. The exercise is one of “putting numbers in boxes”, and by the time the accuracy of the numbers becomes apparent, all those involved are likely to have moved on. This is not conducive to accurate disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might protest that there are many people involved in climate-risk who want to provide accurate and rigorous information that is supported by science, and there are many people who want such information to make accurate disclosures of risk to shareholders. This is true, but it misses the point: the problems in the market for climate-risk information are structural. The used-car market did not become a market for lemons because it was populated by untrustworthy salesmen; it attracted and created the stereotype of the used-car salesman because of its intrinsic information asymmetries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If information asymmetry and the potential for adverse selection in the market for forward-looking climate information is not addressed, it is likely that more evidence will accumulate that undermines the credibility of climate-related risk disclosures. This will make mandatory disclosures a cost to businesses without any offsetting benefit to society.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How good are AGORA forecasts?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Calibration means the frequency of events matches their predicted probabilities”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two desirable characteristics that probability forecasts should have: 
&lt;em&gt;calibration&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sharpness&lt;/em&gt;. Calibration means that the frequency of events matches 
their predicted probabilities while sharpness refers to how often predicted probabilities 
are close to 0% or 100% for binary forecasts or how narrow the forecast distribution is 
for a numerical value. Making sharp forecasts is trivial if you don’t care about 
calibration, so in this blog we will investigate whether forecasts produced by AGORA 
are calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I predict a 90% chance of an event occurring and it doesn’t happen then I am not 
wrong because I allowed for a 10% chance of it not happening. If, however, I repeatedly 
predict a 90% chance of things occurring and they keep failing to happen you will lose 
confidence in my ability as a forecaster. This is because my forecasts are not well
calibrated. Calibration means the frequency of events matches their predicted 
probabilities: for example, if you record all the times I said there was a 60% 
chance of something occurring, that something should have happened 60% of those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;: An illustration of the percentiles of a predicted probability distribution. If the predicted distribution is well calibrated there is a 5% chance the actual value will fall below the 5th percentile, a 25% chance it will fall below the 25th percentile etc.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For well calibrated forecasts of numerical values half the time the actual value 
should fall below the median (50th percentile) of the predicted distribution and 
half the time it should fall above it. Similarly, the actual value should fall 
below the 10th percentile of the predicted distribution in 10 per cent of cases, 
below the 20th percentile in 20 per cent of cases, and so on. These percentiles 
are illustrated in Figure 1. If we plot the percentage of forecasts for which the
actual value falls below a given percentile of the forecast distribution we should 
get a diagonal line. Because we have a finite number of forecasts there will be 
deviations from this line, even if the forecasts are perfectly calibrated, with 
the size of the deviations shrinking as the number of forecasts used in the analysis 
increases.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;: A calibration plot for 23 AGORA probabilistic at a normalized lead time of 0.75 (after 25% of the time between opening and settlement has elapsed). The grey envelope shows the amount of deviation from the diagonal that can be expected if the 23 forecasts were perfectly calibrated. The plot is consistent with AGORA forecasts being well calibrated.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When performing a calibration analysis we need to choose a forecast lead time. If 
all the forecasts in the analysis are of the same type then this is straightforward: 
for example, we might want to check the calibration of rainfall forecasts 3 days 
before the target date. If, however, we are dealing with different types of forecasts, 
choosing a common lead time might not make sense: Harold Wilson said that, “A week 
is a long time in politics”, but a week is no time at all in climate prediction. We 
will express all lead times relative to the duration of the prediction market: A 
normalized lead time of 0.25 means that a quarter of the time between opening and 
settlement remains until settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the calibration of 23 AGORA forecasts. The forecasts included in 
the analysis were all the public markets that have been run on the AGORA platform 
with cash incentives for participants. This includes predictions of monthly UK 
temperature, values of an El Niño-Southern Oscillation index and monthly totals 
of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. The yellow line follows the diagonal with some 
deviations but the deviations lie within the grey envelope, which indicates how 
much deviation would occur with 23 perfectly calibrated forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures 3 and 4 show the calibration plot for normalized lead time of 0.50 and 
0.25. The plot for 0.25 suggests the frequency of the actual value falling below 
the median is only about 30% although this deviation is still consistent with 
calibrated forecasts due to the relatively small number of forecasts in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results show the AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated 
so it is not unreasonable to take the probabilities that AGORA produces at face 
value. Prescriptions of how to make rational decisions in the face of uncertainty 
often assume that quantitative probabilities can be assigned to potential outcomes. 
AGORA prediction markets can be used as a source of these probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
