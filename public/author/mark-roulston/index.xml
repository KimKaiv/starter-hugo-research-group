&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first storm of the 2024 hurricane season has formed in the Gulf region. ALBERTO formed off the coast of Mexico and is currently classed as a tropical storm that has yet to achieve hurricane status.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implied probability, according to prices in the CAHM24 expert prediction market, 
of more than 10 hurricanes has decreased in the last week from 44% to 37% while the 
chances of more than 12 hurricanes remains unchanged at 18%. The chances that the 
record of 15 hurricanes set in 2005 will be equaled or exceeded has increased to 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1. This season is predicted to one of, if not the most, active on record.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implied probability, according to prices in the 
CAHM24 expert prediction market, of more than 10 
hurricanes has increased in the last week from 35% 
to 44% while the chances of more than 12 
hurricanes has doubled from 9% to 18%. The 
chances that the record of 15 hurricanes set in 2005 
will be equaled or exceeded has also ticked up to 
4.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

market for the number of hurricanes in 2024.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Its modal 
prediction is for around 11 or 12 hurricanes, but it suffers 
from an &amp;ldquo;overround&amp;rdquo;, with implied probabilities across all 
outcomes summing to over 200%. This is a problem seen in 
markets that lack arbitrageurs or a well-designed 
automated market maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new commercial forecast has landed as sea-surface temperatures have been at record levels for 1 year and as El Niño is expected to transition into La Niña by mid-summer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the number of organisations issuing predictions 
of Atlantic hurricane activity increases so does the 
usefulness of CRUCIAL’s prediction market which 
can aggregate disparate forecasts, along with the 
views of its expert participants as to their 
credibility, into a unified probability forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reinsurance portal, ARTEMIS, maintains an excellent 
summary page of forecasts for the 2024 hurricane season 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artemis.bm/2024-atlantic-hurricane-season/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
As of this month three organisations have issued forecasts. 
Tropical Storm Risk are predicting 9 hurricanes, Weatherbell 
are predicting 14-16 while the European Centre for Medium 
Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) are predicting 9 
hurricanes, although their prediction only runs to September 
30 and not the end of the official hurricane season on 
November 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://seasonalhurricanepredictions.bsc.es/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Barcelona Supercomputing Centre’s&lt;/a&gt;
forecast comparisons will become available in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Price updates from CAHM24 will be regularly published at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crucialab.net/market/cahm24/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.crucialab.net/market/cahm24/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better information about future climate-related risks is valuable to companies and other organizations, and a new sector of climate service providers has emerged to provide it. Better climate projections might have clear societal benefits but does that make climate analytics an attractive commercial investment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate analytics, the provision of information about present and future climate risks, is a growing industry. In addition to an increasing number of start ups providing climate services, established consultancies and data vendors are developing their own capabilities, sometimes through acquisitions. Climate change is an important problem and better evaluations of climate risks are undoubtedly of benefit to society, but this does not necessarily make climate analytics an attractive investment. How might the economics of the burgeoning climate analytics sector play out? As with climate change itself, we can think about the future of the sector by considering some different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one scenario most long-range climate risk projections end up looking very similar. Many providers base their products on the same publicly available CMIP model runs and then add value by downscaling these simulations to higher resolutions and cross-referencing them with the location of assets and infrastructure. If they use similar downscaling methods, or methods that give similar results, climate risk information will become a commodity and suppliers&amp;rsquo; margins will be squeezed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the long-range predictions of different providers might be materially different. In this scenario users will be faced with the problem of choosing a provider when they have no way to judge the quality of the predictions. Short-range weather forecasters can be assessed on their track records but this is not practical when horizons are measured in years and decades. This is an example of “asymmetric information” between buyers and sellers. Markets suffering for information asymmetries are vulnerable to failure as buyers will not be prepared to pay for quality they can’t verify and sellers won’t invest in quality they can’t demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that one or two providers rise to dominance by securing a large share of the market and become de facto standard setters. Their dominance might not be the result of accuracy, because accuracy cannot be ascertained, but because it is easier for people to justify using a product everyone else is using. Strong branding and positive feedback thus create a barrier to entry for other firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two outcomes are not great for investors as providers will struggle to monetize their forecasts. The third scenario, with a dominant provider, is potentially more attractive for investors who back this provider, if they can identify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenarios outlined above are not the only potential outcomes and climate analytic providers may find ways to avoid commodification and solve the information asymmetry problem. Tackling these issues should be an integral part of any climate service provider’s business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Groundhog Day, and appropriately the CAHM24 prediction of how many hurricanes there will be this year is unchanged since the last bulletin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no significant changes in CAHM24 prices over the past two weeks, reflecting a relative absence of new developments or information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Lea of TSR interviewed by Fox&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Adam Lea recently discussed Tropical Storm Risk’s December forecast on Fox News. His view is that warmer than average Atlantic temperatures are likely to persist through this year and these, combined with neutral to La Niña in the Pacific, point to a season that is more active than the historical averages. Prices in CAHM24 imply that the participants in the market broadly agree with this outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRUCIAL&amp;rsquo;s hurricane prediction market is forecasting a higher-than-average number of hurricanes this year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, WeatherBELL issued a forecast for the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.weatherbell.com/hurricane-season-from-hell-first-look&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hurricane season from hell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, with 14 to 16 hurricanes, but CAHM24 prices imply that few, if any, participants agree with such an extreme outlook at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook of a market participant&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This far out from the hurricane season, it is hard to predict more than very general trends and signals. We have done some initial research into drivers of hurricane activity, and used publicly available forecasts for the evolution of these over the coming months. We also assessed trends from climate change. These led us to expect higher-than-average hurricane activity for the 2024 season. We later found that an organisation, Tropical Storm Risk, had released an extended-range forecast for the 2024 season of 9 hurricanes. This broadly agrees with our initial model.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As new forecasts and other information become available to the participants in the prediction market prices will evolve to reflect their updated probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price updates from CAHM24 will be regularly published at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crucialab.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.crucialab.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      Exceedance probabilities implied by prices in the CAHM24 market for the number of hurricanes during the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAHM24 suggests an elevated likelihood of an active season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season saw 7 hurricanes, slightly above the long-run average of about 6 hurricanes. In terms of the total number of named storms, the 2023 season was the fourth most active on record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAHM24 prediction market to predict the number of hurricanes in the 2024 season opened last month and is currently indicating an elevated probability of an active season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prices suggest a 60% chance there will be more hurricanes during the 2024 season than in 2023, this is similar to the climatology over the past three decades and is slightly lower than the 70% probability of more than 7 hurricanes in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tropicalstormrisk.com/docs/TSRATLForecastDecember2024.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;December forecast from Tropical Storm Risk (TSR)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As new forecasts and other information become available to the participants in the prediction market prices will evolve to reflect their updated probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comment on: New ways to pay for research could boost scientific progress</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mark Roulston commented upon the article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/15/new-ways-to-pay-for-research-could-boost-scientific-progress&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;New ways to pay for research could boost scientific progress&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; which appeared in &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; on 15.11.2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is an alternative to the funding models for scientific research that you discussed. Prediction markets use betting to aggregate expertise and incentivise participants to get it right. They could be used as a mechanism to fund some types of research in a more inclusive and performance-driven way. Where the primary aim of research is a well-specified prediction, climate forecasting for example, using the proven ability of markets to synthesise diverse information could be more effective than traditional grant proposals and peer review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tutorial for CAHM24</title>
      <link>https://www.crucialab.net/post/tutorial-for-cahm24/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CAHM24 prediction market is intended to produce a forecast of how many hurricanes will occur during the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season that represents the collective wisdom and expertise of all those taking part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market will be hosted on the AGORA prediction market platform. The market will open for trading in December 2023 and it will remain open all the way through the season that begins on June 1 and will close on November 30 (although there might be periodic closures for maintenance). The market will be settled using the number of hurricanes that have occur in the Atlantic between June 1 and November 30, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have logged into AGORA select the market tab on the left-hand side and select the Atlantic hurricane market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;: The AGORA platform. Select the market tab on the left-hand side and then select the Atlantic hurricane market.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market has 21 outcomes corresponding to no hurricanes, one hurricane, two hurricanes, and so on up to an outcome that covers 20 or more hurricanes. Each outcome has a current price which is set by the automated market maker based on its relative popularity. In December 2024, when the total number of hurricanes is known, the correct outcome will be worth 1.00 credit while all other outcomes will be worth nothing. After the market has been settled you will be eligible to receive £1 for every credit you’ve accumulated above your initial balance. If your final balance is less than your initial balance, you will receive nothing. The prices can interpreted as implied probabilities. If you believe an outcome is more probable than its current price you might consider buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make trading markets with many outcomes more manageable AGORA allows you to create contracts which cover one or more outcomes. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Create a new contract&lt;/strong&gt; to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;: When creating a contract just click and select the outcomes you want to include in the contract. This contract just contains the outcome of 8 hurricanes.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can click on the outcomes you want to include in the contract. If you only include a small number of outcomes AGORA will provide a default name listing the outcomes. A contract can’t be created without a name. The contracts you create are private, other participants cannot see them. Once you have created a contract it appears in your inventory, and you can buy some units of the contract from the market maker.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;: An order for 100 of the contract “8” has been placed and the market maker is quoting a price of 0.081 per contract. This is slightly higher than the listed price of 0.079 and the difference between quoted and listed prices increases with order size.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can place an order by changing the &lt;strong&gt;Quantity&lt;/strong&gt; column or the &lt;strong&gt;Order&lt;/strong&gt; column. The market maker will quote a price which may differ from the listed price. The difference will be larger for big orders. If the quoted price is acceptable you can click on the &lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt; to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts can cover multiple outcomes. You can click on individual outcomes to add them to a contract, or you can click and hold to include ranges of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sell an outcome just enter a negative number in the &lt;strong&gt;Order&lt;/strong&gt; column or reduce the number in the &lt;strong&gt;Quantity&lt;/strong&gt; column. You cannot “short” a contract, that is you cannot sell a contract that you have not previously bought. Shorting is a strategy used in finance to take advantage of overpricing. However, because on AGORA the outcomes are defined to be mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive (i.e., one and only one outcome must occur) and the prices of outcomes always sum to 1.00 then if you believe any outcome is overpriced then there must be other outcomes that are underpriced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGORA allows you to execute multiple orders simultaneously. If you enter more than one order (buys or sells) the market maker will give you a quote for the entire “basket”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing Climate Forecasting&#39;s Lemon Problem</title>
      <link>https://www.crucialab.net/post/fixing-climate-forecastings-lemon-problem/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:41:05 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.crucialab.net/post/fixing-climate-forecastings-lemon-problem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change will bring warmer temperatures, higher sea levels, and changes in rainfall and windstorms, although some of these consequences are far more certain than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can mitigate climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, but we will have to adapt to a different climate. Deciding how much we should adapt is a trillion-dollar question: Preparing for a worst-case scenario that doesn’t materialize could be as costly as failing to invest enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to ensure that infrastructure and supply-chains are resilient to climate change has created a demand for more detailed climate forecasts. Climate modelling has historically been done by government-funded agencies, with access to supercomputers, but these are now being joined by a proliferation of private companies, ready to satisfy the need for more granular predictions of climate extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Commercial weather forecasters have been a source of innovation&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new industry of “climate analytics” has emerged. The influx of new providers, many backed by venture capital, is welcome. The private sector has provided weather forecasts for many years. Commercial weather forecasters have been a source of innovation and often tailor products to users, such as power companies needing to predict electricity demand. But weather and climate forecasts are different: You can verify weather forecasts after a few days, and in a few months, you’ll know if a forecaster is competent. It can be years, however, or even decades, before the skill of a climate forecaster becomes apparent. When providers are paid upfront for twenty-year forecasts it makes more sense for them to invest in slick marketing than in making their predictions more accurate. George Akerlof won a Nobel Prize for explaining how markets fail when buyers can not evaluate quality. He used the example of low-quality used cars, or “lemons”. Climate forecasting has its own lemon problem, with some products providing precision that cannot be justified, for example. Only sellers of low quality products benefit in this type of market. Consumers and sellers of high quality products lose out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Regulation is more likely to create barriers to entry, and stifle innovation, than to improve forecasts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are deciding where to invest in farmland, or planning a city’s flood defences, there are many climate analytics providers to choose from, but no easy way to distinguish reliable ones from charlatans.   One response has, inevitably, been calls for regulation. But climate analytics is a new and fast-developing field. Novel approaches, including machine learning and AI, are being tried in addition to continual improvements to established methods. No regulator has the expertise to decide which techniques will succeed. Regulation is more likely to create barriers to entry, and stifle innovation, than to improve forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative to regulation would be to replace the existing and extemporary marketplace for climate analytics, which rewards marketing prowess, with a deliberately designed market which rewards accuracy. Futures markets settled on climate-related variables, rather than asset prices, would achieve this. The markets would not be for hedging risks but for aggregating the expertise of participants and providing incentives for them to get it right. Markets designed to obtain information, rather than transfer assets or risks, are dubbed “prediction markets”. Their prevailing prices can be interpreted as probabilities of different outcomes — implied forecasts emerging from the collective wisdom of participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of hedgers, a climate prediction market would need to be subsidized — we shouldn’t expect to get information for free. There is a case that climate predictions should be a public good so the government could provide some subsidies. Governments are already spending millions of dollars on climate forecasting research and a well-designed market could channel this funding to providers based on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prediction markets have been suggested as a tool for policymakers in the past but have failed to catch on. Anti-gambling laws have been an obstacle but so has a lack of subsidies to attract participants to markets on specialized topics. Getting governments to rethink the way they fund climate forecasting is a major challenge, but companies and philanthropists can lead the way. They can pioneer a more efficient and transparent way of distributing money than selecting and contracting with individual providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies, public agencies, and non-profits who want more accurate climate forecasts, as well as providers investing in R&amp;amp;D to make them more accurate, have an interest in fixing the market for climate forecasts. The more accurately we can predict future climate, the more cost effectively we can adapt to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AGORA is a platform for hosting prediction markets in which participants can bet 
on the outcome of events or the values of particular quantities. This article is 
an introduction to trading on AGORA prediction markets. We will cover the 
mechanics of how you place trades and also offer some tips on how to translate 
your judgments and opinions into trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been invited to participate in an AGORA market then you can login to the platform and you will see a screen showing a list of the individual markets open to you (your list will be different to the one below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click on the “accounts” icon (the head and shoulders) you will see a list of your accounts with the markets that use that account listed underneath each one. If two markets belong to the same account then credits earned in one market may be used in the other market but credits cannot be transferred from a market under one account to a market under another account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To trade, you select the “markets” icon (the four panels) and then select a market, 
e.g. the “Strictly Come Dancing Winner” market. This demonstration market is for 
predicting the winner of the 2018 series of BBC’s &lt;em&gt;Strictly Come Dancing&lt;/em&gt; programme 
(Americans will know this programme as &lt;em&gt;Dancing with the Stars&lt;/em&gt;). In the programme 
15 celebrities compete at dancing with one celebrity being ejected from the competition 
each week. This market is, as the British election commentator Peter Snow might say, 
“just a bit of fun”, but it illustrates many of the key features of AGORA. This market 
has 15 distinct outcomes. In all AGORA markets, outcomes are &lt;em&gt;Mutually Exclusive and 
Comprehensively Exhaustive&lt;/em&gt; (MECE): this means that only one outcome can occur but 
one outcome must occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure above is the market screen for the &lt;em&gt;Strictly&lt;/em&gt; market. The number of credits you have in this market space is shown at the top. The current prices for each outcome are shown in the bar graph. The favourite is Joe Sugg with a price of 0.132. This price can be interpreted as the probability of Joe Sugg winning. AGORA allows you to define contracts that cover one or more outcomes. You can then buy one or more of the contracts you define. At settlement you will receive 1.00 credit for each contract you hold that covers the outcome that actually occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To define a contract click on the “+” icon, then click on one or more outcomes that you want covered by the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest type of contract covers a single outcome. For example, the figure above shows a contract that covers Joe Sugg winning. AGORA has automatically named this contract “Joe Sugg” but you are free to rename the contract if you want. Contract definitions are specific to you — other participants do not see your contracts and must define their own. If you click “create” the Joe Sugg contract is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts can cover more than one outcome. For example, you can create a contract covering all the female contestants and name the contract “Female Winner”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your portfolio is shown below the price bar chart. AGORA uses a market maker that will always quote a price for a contract. These prices are shown in the PRICE column. The QUANTITY column shows how many units of each contract you currently hold. To buy contracts you can either specify the number you wish to have in the QUANTITY field or you can specify a change in your inventory in the ORDER field. Although you have defined two contracts you have not yet bought any so you can delete the definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the figure above, an order to buy 100 of the Joe Sugg contract has been placed and the market maker is quoting a price of 0.138 per contract. This is slightly higher than the 0.132 in the PRICE column because the market maker raises the price a bit in response to the buy order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-long-and-going-short&#34;&gt;Going Long and Going Short&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a contract pays out 1.00 credit if an outcome covered by the contract occurs it follows that the expected value of the contract is the probability that the outcome occurs. If you think that the probability of a contract paying out is substantially higher than the quoted price then you have a reason to buy the contract, or “go long” in the parlance of financial markets. But, what if you think the quoted price of a contract is significantly higher than the probability of it paying out? In other words, what if you think a contract is overvalued? How can you exploit such a mispricing? The AGORA platform does not allow you to “go short” — sell contracts you don’t already own — which is what speculators do to stocks they think are overpriced. However, the prices of all outcomes always sum to 1.00: if you buy one unit of every outcome it will cost you 1.00 (but you are guaranteed a pay out of 1.00 at settlement). This means that if you think any outcome is overvalued there must be other outcomes that are undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!(Selling the complementary contract; going short](complementary-contract.png &amp;ldquo;Figure 9**: If you think Ashley Roberts is overvalued we can define a complementary contract which will be undervalued.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you think that former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts is overvalued — yes she’s good but you think the judges and voting public will be harsher on her due to her previous dancing experience — you can define a contract covering all the other contestants as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that contracts covering complete sets of outcomes sum to 1.00 you can also define a contract for Ashley Roberts. The prices of these two complementary contracts sum to 1.00. If you think the “Ashley Roberts” contract is overvalued the contract “NOT Ashley Roberts” must be undervalued, so you can express your view by buying this contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Strictly Come Dancing&lt;/em&gt; market is an example of a market for a categorical variable that can take on one of several distinct values. AGORA also supports markets for continuous variables by partitioning the variable into discrete intervals. To illustrate this lets look at a demonstration market for the UK unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11&lt;/strong&gt;: The UK Unemployment rate can be partitioned into intervals of 0.1%. This interval covers the range 5.4% to 8.4%.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of National Statistics reports the UK unemployment rate to an accuracy of 
0.1% so this is a sensible interval for partitioning this variable. Trading individual 
outcomes covering just 0.1% would be cumbersome but because of the way AGORA lets you 
define contracts you can create contracts covering intervals, including multiple 
disjoint intervals. Note that the individual intervals for unemployment are represented 
as intervals that are “closed” at the lower end and “open” on the upper end. This is 
written as [8.3%,8.4%) and means the interval includes 8.3% but not 8.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bayesian statistics a credible interval is a range in which a variable will fall with a specified subjective probability. Let’s suppose &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; 90% credible interval for UK unemployment in Q4 of 2019 is 5.4% to 8.4%. You can define a contract covering this interval and get a price quote for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example above, you are being quoted a price of just 0.222 for this interval. 
If you really think the probability of the true value falling in this range is 90% 
this contract has an expected value of 0.90 so it’s a very good buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;market-settlement&#34;&gt;Market Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a market settles, all contracts covering the correct outcome pay out 1.00 credit 
which is added to your credit balance. All other contracts are worthless. All AGORA 
markets are denominated in credits. 
In markets run by CRUCIAL, these credits represent shares of the segregated research funding pool.&lt;/p&gt;

in markets in which you have been invited to participate. As you become more familiar with 
AGORA markets you may wish to implement more intricate trading strategies using the API.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Information markets use market-like 
mechanisms to elicit and aggregate 
information. Information markets are not 
designed to transfer ownership or risk but to 
exploit the proven ability of markets to 
discover and synthesize information. 
Information markets can solve the problems of 
aggregating diverse climate expertise and
aligning the incentives of providers. They
could become the primary mechanism for 
obtaining forward-looking expertise about 
climate-related risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Climate change is recognised as an important 
source of risk. Regulators now believe that 
climate-related risks pose, not only a threat to 
individual firms, but possibly to the stability of 
the financial system.
In 2017 the G20’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
published recommendations that firms should 
disclose forward-looking information about 
physical and transition climate-related risks. 
More than two thousand companies have 
voluntarily signed-up to these 
recommendations. Regulators and exchanges 
in many countries plan to make climate-related disclosures mandatory. These trends 
have created a demand for forward-looking 
information about climate, such as emissions 
pathways and changes in physical climate 
risks. Companies requiring this information 
are a nascent source of funding for applied 
climate research. They are particularly 
interested in the efficiency with which 
distributed information can be aggregated 
and communicated for use in decision making 
and risk management. 
The marketplace for climate information is 
diverse and fragmented. Relevant expertise 
exists in public agencies, academia, think 
tanks, as well as an emerging class of private 
companies known as climate service 
providers (CSPs). Given the long horizons 
involved, few providers have established track 
records, so it is difficult for users to evaluate 
their skill. Furthermore, most forecasts are 
offered with no warranty. This creates a 
situation in which bad forecasts can drive out 
good ones; a situation reminiscent of credit 
ratings for mortgage-backed securities in the 
run-up to the subprime crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
We propose a climate information exchange 
that hosts markets predicting climate-related 
variables. These variables will include high-level ones, such as global greenhouse gas 
concentrations, and more granular ones like
sea-level rise in specific locations. Market 
participants will include individuals and 
institutions with expertise across the range of 
disciplines relevant to climate forecasting, 
including meteorology, climatology, 
economics, social sciences, and policy. 
Participants will use on-platform credits 
representing a claim on a proportion of 
research funds distributed through the 
exchange. These funds will come from public, 
private, and philanthropic sources interested 
in effective altruism.
The exchange will use AGORA, developed by 
Hivemind Technologies Ltd. AGORA has been 
used to run expert information markets for 
seasonal forecasts, El Niño events, Atlantic 
hurricane activity, and crop yields. AGORA
solves several problems that have afflicted 
previous attempts to create information 
markets for climate: an automated market 
maker guarantees liquidity allowing markets 
to function in the absence of uninformed 
“noise” traders. AGORA supports very large 
outcome spaces, enabling consensus 
probability distributions to be extracted, not 
just probabilities for binary events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Many of the markets will have horizons of 
more than a decade. The consensus forecasts 
generated will be a public good, to be 
distributed for free. There is a strong case for 
the exchange to be hosted by a university, 
which will become a hub for international 
climate expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why no climate warranties?</title>
      <link>https://www.crucialab.net/post/why-no-climate-warranties/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 18:41:05 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.crucialab.net/post/why-no-climate-warranties/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The market for climate risk forecasts suffers from a problem economists call 
“asymmetric information”: the sellers of forecasts probably know more about their 
accuracy than the buyers. A short or medium range weather forecast can be verified 
in a couple of weeks, and reasonable statistics about their accuracy can be 
accumulated in a matter of months but, because a climate forecast might not verify 
for years or decades, buyers cannot usually use a forecaster’s track record to assess 
their accuracy. A market in which the quality of a product won’t be apparent for years 
is susceptible to “adverse selection”, which is economists’ way of saying it will be 
a magnet for charlatans. This creates a challenge for providers of climate forecasts 
who are competent and have invested in research and development to improve the accuracy: 
how can they persuade buyers that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are not charlatans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Talk is cheap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate service providers can emphasise their credentials and highlight the scientific 
effort that goes into their products; they might allow users to see how their models 
work &amp;mdash; although many users don’t have the expertise to assess the models, and if the 
seller uses proprietary models this might not be option anyway. The problem with these 
solutions is that “talk is cheap”, and it is difficult for a buyer to distinguish 
authentic expertise from slick marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economist George Akerlof, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on information 
asymmetries, explained the problem in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1879431&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;classic paper published in 1970&lt;/a&gt; which 
described the market for used cars. As with climate forecasts, it is difficult 
for the buyer of a used car to know its quality and, also like climate forecasts, 
a car is an infrequent purchase so there is little opportunity to accumulate much 
first-hand knowledge about the reliability of a seller. These attributes made the 
market for used cars attractive to less-than-reputable characters, creating the 
stereotype of the untrustworthy used-car dealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dealers offered warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reputation of used-car dealers has improved since the 1970s, partly because 
the sector adopted one of the strategies for dealing with asymmetric information 
described by Akerlof: offering cash back warranties. In the U.K. used-car 
warranties became mandatory in 2015, but even before then, dealers offered 
warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors and enable them to 
charge higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promise of a refund if a product fails can serve two distinct purposes: 
indemnifying the buyer for losses caused by the failure and providing a credible 
signal that the seller believes failure is unlikely. An inaccurate climate 
forecast may cause the user a loss far above the price they paid for the forecast: 
for example, they may build sea defences that are too low, or too high. While a 
forecast provider might not be able to indemnify the user against all costs, 
they can still offer a refund to signal their confidence in the accuracy of the 
forecast. The credibility of the signal is determined, not by whether the refund 
will compensate the user, but whether it will be painful for the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate forecasts, generally, are not categorically right or wrong: they are 
probabilistic forecasts — or they should be — in which probabilities are assigned 
to specified outcomes. How could the terms of a refund be structured for this type 
of product? There is a literature on this subject going back 70 years, when &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/78/1/1520-0493_1950_078_0001_vofeit_2_0_co_2.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Glenn 
Brier introduced a quadratic scoring rule for assessing probability forecasts&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984087&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;I.J. Good suggested the logarithmic scoring rule as a way to reward forecasters.&lt;/a&gt; 
Since then more work has been done on the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/Gneiting2007jasa.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;“proper scoring rules”&lt;/a&gt; for 
incentivizing forecasters. More recently, proper scoring rules have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/43189651&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;suggested 
as the basis for incentives that screen the views of informed and uninformed experts 
when only a single forecast is being made.&lt;/a&gt; There are subtleties to be appreciated, 
and pitfalls to avoid, but in principle a proper scoring rule could be used to 
evaluate the quality of a probabilistic forecast and determine the refund to which 
the buyer is entitled. This can only be done when the actual outcome becomes known, 
which in some cases may be more than twenty years after the forecast is made. Some 
people might think that providing a warranty on a timescale of decades is 
unrealistic but other industries do it: e.g., 10-year structural warranties for 
new houses or the lifetime warranties offered by high-end manufacturers that can 
be claimed decades after a product is purchased. It is also analogous to deferring 
bonuses in the finance industry. Climate service providers unwilling to expose 
themselves to some risk on climatic timescales are arguably in the wrong business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A well-structured warranty can be used to communicate how much confidence a forecast provider has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information asymmetry in the market for climate forecasts is at least as bad 
as the one for used cars, so why aren’t warranties commonplace? There is no need 
for a regulator to force forecasters to provide warranties. As with used-cars, 
any provider is free to unilaterally offer warranties to differentiate themselves. 
One possibility is that few climate service providers have enough confidence in 
their forecasts to give warranties. However, a probabilistic forecast combined 
with a well-structured warranty can be used to communicate how much (or little) 
confidence a forecast provider has, and this is information that the forecast user 
should want. An alternative explanation is that there is little demand from buyers 
for sellers to provide a credible signal of their confidence in forecast accuracy. 
This interpretation is consistent with the view that buyers of climate risk 
information use it to satisfy regulators, auditors, or other stakeholders, but 
aren’t really worried about its accuracy; they just need it to give them “plausible 
deniability”. Worse than indifference, is the possibility that some organisations 
&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; inaccurate forecasts. Back in the early 2000s, the issuers of mortgage-backed 
securities didn’t want accurate credit ratings for them, they wanted top-notch 
ratings, even if these did not reflect the true risk of default. These issuers would 
play rating agencies off against each other to get their desired ratings, and the 
ensuing proliferation of mis-rated securities contributed to the subprime crisis of 
2007/08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-users of climate risk forecasts who care about accuracy should signal their 
commitment by being prepared to pay more for forecasts that come with a warranty. 
This will motivate reputable providers to offer such guarantees, thus differentiating 
themselves from less able providers. Without a strategy to combat asymmetric 
information about climate forecasts it is possible that climate service providers 
will gradually acquire the reputation of 1970s used-car dealers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cost witout benefit</title>
      <link>https://www.crucialab.net/post/cost-without-benefit/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 18:41:05 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.crucialab.net/post/cost-without-benefit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1970, the economist George Akerlof published what would become a classic paper called, 
“&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1879431&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and Market Mechanisms.&lt;/a&gt;” The “lemons” he was 
referring to were low-quality used cars. His insight was that, in markets where buyers 
cannot evaluate products, they will not pay a premium for purported high quality. This, 
in turn, will give sellers little incentive to provide high quality products. Consequently, 
the average quality of products in the market declines, further reducing the amount buyers 
are willing to pay. In economics jargon an “information asymmetry” between buyers and sellers 
results in “adverse selection”. The process identified by Akerlof is now a textbook example 
of market failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The used car market is not the only one susceptible to the “lemon” problem. (Ironically, in the market for actual lemons, buyers can easily assess freshness and taste). A rapidly growing market that is also vulnerable is the one for information about long-range climate risks. A buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them. They just need to know some statistics and be able to collect a sufficiently large sample of forecasts and subsequent outcomes to estimate the skill of the provider. For forecasts 1–2 days ahead, this sample might be obtained in a matter of months. However, companies increasingly need forecasts of climate-related risks on horizons of years, and even decades. Obviously, on these time scales, waiting to see how forecasts turn out before choosing a provider is not practical. Some providers want to keep their models and methods proprietary, but even with full transparency it can be hard for non-specialists to judge their quality. When a market has these characteristics, buyers need to be alert to the danger that bad products will crowd out good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are theoretical reasons why the quality of climate information may deteriorate, but is 
there evidence of this happening in practice? In 2019, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay8442&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;article in Science&lt;/a&gt; suggested that 
some climate information products might be “&amp;hellip;operating outside of the bounds of scientific merit” 
and, if you work in the field of climate risk, you have probably heard stories of providers 
pushing precision and granularity beyond what is scientifically plausible. But is there systematic 
evidence that some climate information has a lemon flavour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortcomings in long-range climate-related predictions might not become apparent for years but there are already indications of problems. Hain et al. recently looked at six different metrics of firm-level exposure to physical climate risks. Three of the measures, from TruCost (part of S&amp;amp;P), Carbon4 Finance and South Pole, were based on the output of climate models, while the other three, from Truvalue Labs (part of FactSet) and two academic groups were constructed by analysing the content of social media, earnings calls and 10-K filings. The correlations between the metrics were generally low, both overall and within specific sectors. Indeed, after allowing for the multiplicity of correlations tested, there were arguably no significant correlations between different metrics. Think about this for a moment: six metrics all claiming to measure the same thing, or at least to be proxies for the same thing, yet they don’t correlate with each other. Even the most generous interpretation implies that most of the metrics contain little information about the common factor they claim to measure. Perhaps one of the metrics is a good measure, but which one? Perhaps none of the metrics are informative. Consider an analogy in which there are six different blood tests to measure the same substance, but when hundreds of subjects are given all six tests there is no correlation between the results. Would a doctor base clinical decisions on any of these tests? Would a medical regulator allow such a situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the accuracy becomes apparent all those involved are likely to have moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem of information asymmetry between buyers and sellers might be compounded when the buyers of climate information are not concerned with the accuracy of the information either. Much of the demand for forward-looking climate information is driven by regulators and shareholders expecting firms to disclose their climate-related risks. The exercise is one of “putting numbers in boxes”, and by the time the accuracy of the numbers becomes apparent, all those involved are likely to have moved on. This is not conducive to accurate disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you might protest that there are many people involved in climate-risk who want to provide accurate and rigorous information that is supported by science, and there are many people who want such information to make accurate disclosures of risk to shareholders. This is true, but it misses the point: the problems in the market for climate-risk information are structural. The used-car market did not become a market for lemons because it was populated by untrustworthy salesmen; it attracted and created the stereotype of the used-car salesman because of its intrinsic information asymmetries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If information asymmetry and the potential for adverse selection in the market for forward-looking climate information is not addressed, it is likely that more evidence will accumulate that undermines the credibility of climate-related risk disclosures. This will make mandatory disclosures a cost to businesses without any offsetting benefit to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;: The evolution of the AGORA prediction market forecast for the total number of hurricanes during the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 30 the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season came to an end and Hivemind settled prediction markets forecasting how many hurricanes there would be and how many would make landfall over the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2020 hurricane season was one of the most active ever seen. There were 30 named storms, beating the 2005 record of 28. Of the 30 storms, 13 achieved hurricane strength and 6 of those made landfall over the U.S., with a further 4 making landfall over Central America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its participation in the Fifth Cohort of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lloydslab.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lloyd’s Lab InsurTech accelerator&lt;/a&gt;, Hivemind ran hurricane prediction markets on its AGORA prediction market platform. Twenty experts in meteorology and statistical climatology from academia and the private sector took part. The market opened in August when the season was underway and three hurricanes had already occurred. Forecasts from groups at &lt;a href=&#34;https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Colorado State University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tropicalstormrisk.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tropical Storm Risk&lt;/a&gt; were for an active season with 12 and 10 hurricanes respectively. This information was immediately priced into the market, with the expected number of hurricanes jumping from the climatological average of 6 to around 10 on opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the season progressed the market expectation fluctuated in response to the formation of new storms — increasing to 12 when three hurricanes formed in the space of a week and falling back during a two week period with no hurricanes. It rose again as a succession of storms formed that meant, as in 2005, the National Hurricane Centre exhausted their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;alphabetized storm names&lt;/a&gt; and had to resort to Greek letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hailiang Du, Assistant Professor of Statistics at Durham University, finished top in the market for the total number of hurricanes. “I usually looked at NOAA 5-day and 2-day outlooks, sometimes also European model runs as well as Canadian models,” explained Professor Du, “I tried to aggregate the model information together to form my own forecast probability distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AGORA hurricane prediction markets demonstrate how prediction markets assimilate new information as it becomes available. Unlike surveys, which provide a snapshot of views at a point in time, prediction markets allow participants to update their positions in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGORA prediction markets could be used to generate pre-season forecasts of hurricane activity. Markets for multiple years ahead could also produce consensus predictions of the impact climate change may have on storm frequencies and intensities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <title>How good are AGORA forecasts?</title>
      <link>https://www.crucialab.net/post/how-good-are-agora-forecasts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2020 18:41:05 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.crucialab.net/post/how-good-are-agora-forecasts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Calibration means the frequency of events matches their predicted probabilities”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two desirable characteristics that probability forecasts should have:
&lt;em&gt;calibration&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sharpness&lt;/em&gt;. Calibration means that the frequency of events matches
their predicted probabilities while sharpness refers to how often predicted probabilities
are close to 0% or 100% for binary forecasts or how narrow the forecast distribution is
for a numerical value. Making sharp forecasts is trivial if you don’t care about
calibration, so in this blog we will investigate whether forecasts produced by AGORA
are calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I predict a 90% chance of an event occurring and it doesn’t happen then I am not
wrong because I allowed for a 10% chance of it not happening. If, however, I repeatedly
predict a 90% chance of things occurring and they keep failing to happen you will lose
confidence in my ability as a forecaster. This is because my forecasts are not well
calibrated. Calibration means the frequency of events matches their predicted
probabilities: for example, if you record all the times I said there was a 60%
chance of something occurring, that something should have happened 60% of those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;: An illustration of the percentiles of a predicted probability distribution. If the predicted distribution is well calibrated there is a 5% chance the actual value will fall below the 5th percentile, a 25% chance it will fall below the 25th percentile etc.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For well calibrated forecasts of numerical values half the time the actual value
should fall below the median (50th percentile) of the predicted distribution and
half the time it should fall above it. Similarly, the actual value should fall
below the 10th percentile of the predicted distribution in 10 per cent of cases,
below the 20th percentile in 20 per cent of cases, and so on. These percentiles
are illustrated in Figure 1. If we plot the percentage of forecasts for which the
actual value falls below a given percentile of the forecast distribution we should
get a diagonal line. Because we have a finite number of forecasts there will be
deviations from this line, even if the forecasts are perfectly calibrated, with
the size of the deviations shrinking as the number of forecasts used in the analysis
increases.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;: A calibration plot for 23 AGORA probabilistic at a normalized lead time of 0.75 (after 25% of the time between opening and settlement has elapsed). The grey envelope shows the amount of deviation from the diagonal that can be expected if the 23 forecasts were perfectly calibrated. The plot is consistent with AGORA forecasts being well calibrated.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When performing a calibration analysis we need to choose a forecast lead time. If
all the forecasts in the analysis are of the same type then this is straightforward:
for example, we might want to check the calibration of rainfall forecasts 3 days
before the target date. If, however, we are dealing with different types of forecasts,
choosing a common lead time might not make sense: Harold Wilson said that, “A week
is a long time in politics”, but a week is no time at all in climate prediction. We
will express all lead times relative to the duration of the prediction market: A
normalized lead time of 0.25 means that a quarter of the time between opening and
settlement remains until settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the calibration of 23 AGORA forecasts. The forecasts included in
the analysis were all the public markets that have been run on the AGORA platform
with cash incentives for participants. This includes predictions of monthly UK
temperature, values of an El Niño-Southern Oscillation index and monthly totals
of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. The yellow line follows the diagonal with some
deviations but the deviations lie within the grey envelope, which indicates how
much deviation would occur with 23 perfectly calibrated forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures 3 and 4 show the calibration plot for normalized lead time of 0.50 and
0.25. The plot for 0.25 suggests the frequency of the actual value falling below
the median is only about 30% although this deviation is still consistent with
calibrated forecasts due to the relatively small number of forecasts in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results show the AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated
so it is not unreasonable to take the probabilities that AGORA produces at face
value. Prescriptions of how to make rational decisions in the face of uncertainty
often assume that quantitative probabilities can be assigned to potential outcomes.
AGORA prediction markets can be used as a source of these probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
