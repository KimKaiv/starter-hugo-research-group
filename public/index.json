Experts from academia and the private sector took part in these markets, which generated probability forecasts that synthesised their knowledge and evolved as new information became available.\nPrediction markets have characteristics which are useful for long-range climate-risk forecasting. They incentivise and reward participants with distinct expertise and information to come forward. They also provide a level playing field for experts from different — yet complementary — fields of expertise.\nUnderstanding emissions pathways requires diverse and complementary expertise from political science, economics and policy, as well as country-specific knowledge for the largest emitters.\nThe AGORA Prediction Market platform can integrate this expertise with that of climate scientists, whose models are conditioned on emissions scenarios. Also, as the markets are being run to generate information as a public good, rather than for private profit, the incentives to skew evaluations to suit any one organisation are mitigated.\nMark Roulston, who oversaw the development of AGORA and is now working on the climate initiative, said: “The prediction market approach should interest governments, companies and philanthropists who want to fund climate research from diverse sources in an efficient and performance-driven way.”\nHivemind’s shareholders: Winton Group (“Winton”) is a research-based investment management company with a specialist focus on statistical and mathematical inference in financial markets.

Information markets use market-like mechanisms to elicit and aggregate information. Information markets are not designed to transfer ownership or risk but to exploit the proven ability of markets to discover and synthesize information. Information markets can solve the problems of aggregating diverse climate expertise and aligning the incentives of providers. They could become the primary mechanism for obtaining forward-looking expertise about climate-related risks.\nWhy? Climate change is recognised as an important source of risk. Regulators now believe that climate-related risks pose, not only a threat to individual firms, but possibly to the stability of the financial system. In 2017 the G20’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) published recommendations that firms should disclose forward-looking information about physical and transition climate-related risks. More than two thousand companies have voluntarily signed-up to these recommendations. Regulators and exchanges in many countries plan to make climate-related disclosures mandatory. These trends have created a demand for forward-looking information about climate, such as emissions pathways and changes in physical climate risks. Companies requiring this information are a nascent source of funding for applied climate research. They are particularly interested in the efficiency with which distributed information can be aggregated and communicated for use in decision making and risk management. The marketplace for climate information is diverse and fragmented. Relevant expertise exists in public agencies, academia, think tanks, as well as an emerging class of private companies known as climate service providers (CSPs). Given the long horizons involved, few providers have established track records, so it is difficult for users to evaluate their skill. Furthermore, most forecasts are offered with no warranty. This creates a situation in which bad forecasts can drive out good ones; a situation reminiscent of credit ratings for mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the subprime crisis.\nHow? We propose a climate information exchange that hosts markets predicting climate-related variables. These variables will include high-level ones, such as global greenhouse gas concentrations, and more granular ones like sea-level rise in specific locations. Market participants will include individuals and institutions with expertise across the range of disciplines relevant to climate forecasting, including meteorology, climatology, economics, social sciences, and policy. Participants will use on-platform credits representing a claim on a proportion of research funds distributed through the exchange. These funds will come from public, private, and philanthropic sources interested in effective altruism. The exchange will use AGORA, developed by Hivemind Technologies Ltd. AGORA has been used to run expert information markets for seasonal forecasts, El Niño events, Atlantic hurricane activity, and crop yields. AGORA solves several problems that have afflicted previous attempts to create information markets for climate: an automated market maker guarantees liquidity allowing markets to function in the absence of uninformed “noise” traders. AGORA supports very large outcome spaces, enabling consensus probability distributions to be extracted, not just probabilities for binary events.\nWhere? Many of the markets will have horizons of more than a decade. The consensus forecasts generated will be a public good, to be distributed for free. There is a strong case for the exchange to be hosted by a university, which will become a hub for international climate expertise.\n","date":1656630086,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656630086,"objectID":"266f8a4337e55c6b553ff42ffc5a1d30","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/publication/crucial-white-paper/","publishdate":"2022-09-04T18:38:26+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/crucial-white-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"A proposal for generating forward-looking climate-risk information with expert prediction markets.","tags":["greenhouse gas emissions","temperature anomaly","prediction markets","climate risk","climate change","adverse incentives","methdologocial choice","multi-disciplinarity","circularity problem","data gaps"],"title":"CRUCIAL White Paper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Roulston"],"categories":[],"content":"The market for climate risk forecasts suffers from a problem economists call “asymmetric information”: the sellers of forecasts probably know more about their accuracy than the buyers. A short or medium range weather forecast can be verified in a couple of weeks, and reasonable statistics about their accuracy can be accumulated in a matter of months but, because a climate forecast might not verify for years or decades, buyers cannot usually use a forecaster’s track record to assess their accuracy. A market in which the quality of a product won’t be apparent for years is susceptible to “adverse selection”, which is economists’ way of saying it will be a magnet for charlatans. This creates a challenge for providers of climate forecasts who are competent and have invested in research and development to improve the accuracy: how can they persuade buyers that they are not charlatans?\n“Talk is cheap.”\nClimate service providers can emphasise their credentials and highlight the scientific effort that goes into their products; they might allow users to see how their models work — although many users don’t have the expertise to assess the models, and if the seller uses proprietary models this might not be option anyway. The problem with these solutions is that “talk is cheap”, and it is difficult for a buyer to distinguish authentic expertise from slick marketing.\nThe economist George Akerlof, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on information asymmetries, explained the problem in a classic paper published in 1970 which described the market for used cars. As with climate forecasts, it is difficult for the buyer of a used car to know its quality and, also like climate forecasts, a car is an infrequent purchase so there is little opportunity to accumulate much first-hand knowledge about the reliability of a seller. These attributes made the market for used cars attractive to less-than-reputable characters, creating the stereotype of the untrustworthy used-car dealer.\n“Dealers offered warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors.”\nThe reputation of used-car dealers has improved since the 1970s, partly because the sector adopted one of the strategies for dealing with asymmetric information described by Akerlof: offering cash back warranties. In the U.K. used-car warranties became mandatory in 2015, but even before then, dealers offered warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors and enable them to charge higher prices.\nA promise of a refund if a product fails can serve two distinct purposes: indemnifying the buyer for losses caused by the failure and providing a credible signal that the seller believes failure is unlikely. An inaccurate climate forecast may cause the user a loss far above the price they paid for the forecast: for example, they may build sea defences that are too low, or too high. While a forecast provider might not be able to indemnify the user against all costs, they can still offer a refund to signal their confidence in the accuracy of the forecast. The credibility of the signal is determined, not by whether the refund will compensate the user, but whether it will be painful for the provider.\nClimate forecasts, generally, are not categorically right or wrong: they are probabilistic forecasts — or they should be — in which probabilities are assigned to specified outcomes. How could the terms of a refund be structured for this type of product? There is a literature on this subject going back 70 years, when Glenn Brier introduced a quadratic scoring rule for assessing probability forecasts and I.J. Good suggested the logarithmic scoring rule as a way to reward forecasters. Since then more work has been done on the concept of “proper scoring rules” for incentivizing forecasters. More recently, proper scoring rules have been suggested as the basis for incentives that screen the views of informed and uninformed experts when only a single forecast is being made. There are subtleties to be appreciated, and pitfalls to avoid, but in principle a proper scoring rule could be used to evaluate the quality of a probabilistic forecast and determine the refund to which the buyer is entitled. This can only be done when the actual outcome becomes known, which in some cases may be more than twenty years after the forecast is made. Some people might think that providing a warranty on a timescale of decades is unrealistic but other industries do it: e.g., 10-year structural warranties for new houses or the lifetime warranties offered by high-end manufacturers that can be claimed decades after a product is purchased. It is also analogous to deferring bonuses in the finance industry. Climate service providers unwilling to expose themselves to some risk on climatic timescales are arguably in the wrong business.\n“A well-structured warranty can be used to communicate how much confidence a forecast provider has.”\nThe information asymmetry in the market for climate forecasts is at least as bad as the one for …","date":1646934065,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646934065,"objectID":"e0c9090f38ec3b222a2e0339795b6068","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/why-no-climate-warranties/","publishdate":"2022-03-10T18:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/why-no-climate-warranties/","section":"post","summary":"The market for climate risk forecasts suffers from information asymmetries which could be mitigated by warranties from forecast providers.

There are many sources of information and expertise, but decision-makers face significant difficulties in accessing, interpreting, and appraising it.\n“This workshop provided the opportunity for academia and finance professionals to discuss how we can establish a UK-based prediction market exchange that will seek to deliver robust and publicly available climate forecasts. It could serve as a mechanism to fund research that targets the highest priority climate risks of sponsoring institutions in an incentive compatible way for providers.”\nIn his presentation at Woburn House, Dr Kaivanto outlined structural issues with the climate risk information and forecast markets, including how the decadal “discovery times” required to ascertain the accuracy of climate forecasts creates an information asymmetry in which providers are likely to know more about the quality of the forecasts than users. This asymmetry makes the market vulnerable to adverse selection in which low-quality forecasts drive out higher-quality forecasts.\nHe also discussed the potential risks of relying on single models and providers for climate risk assessment, and the circularity problem in climate prediction, and how it might be solved by allowing forecasters to make predictions of climate conditioned on greenhouse gas concentrations, which is possible using two-dimensional, joint-outcome markets (e.g. CO2 concentration and global temperature anomaly).\nThe session concluded that participants in prediction markets should be seen as sources of information who are rewarded for impounding their information into prediction market prices, not as sources of revenue for the market maker, or for better-informed or quicker market participants. Selection of participants – potentially restricted to individuals or organisations (academic, private sector or NGOs) – would allow for a diverse and credible pool of expertise, adding to the credibility of the markets.\nParticipants also concluded that the information the markets would generate would have the attributes of a ‘public good’: non-rival and non-excludable, with funding typically from governments, philanthropic foundations, or consortia of end-users – the latter of whom could limit access to the information, for more of a ‘club good’.\nThis report on the workshop originally appeared here.\n","date":1644328800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644328800,"objectID":"4e1bd5b69799a967d079db5700c50555","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/event/woburn-house/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/woburn-house/","section":"event","summary":"A workshop about an initiative to address emerging problems with the provision of climate risk information.","tags":[],"title":"Prediction Markets for Climate Risk","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mark Roulston"],"categories":[],"content":"In 1970, the economist George Akerlof published what would become a classic paper called, “The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and Market Mechanisms.” The “lemons” he was referring to were low-quality used cars. His insight was that, in markets where buyers cannot evaluate products, they will not pay a premium for purported high quality. This, in turn, will give sellers little incentive to provide high quality products. Consequently, the average quality of products in the market declines, further reducing the amount buyers are willing to pay. In economics jargon an “information asymmetry” between buyers and sellers results in “adverse selection”. The process identified by Akerlof is now a textbook example of market failure.\nA buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them.\nThe used car market is not the only one susceptible to the “lemon” problem. (Ironically, in the market for actual lemons, buyers can easily assess freshness and taste). A rapidly growing market that is also vulnerable is the one for information about long-range climate risks. A buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them. They just need to know some statistics and be able to collect a sufficiently large sample of forecasts and subsequent outcomes to estimate the skill of the provider. For forecasts 1–2 days ahead, this sample might be obtained in a matter of months. However, companies increasingly need forecasts of climate-related risks on horizons of years, and even decades. Obviously, on these time scales, waiting to see how forecasts turn out before choosing a provider is not practical. Some providers want to keep their models and methods proprietary, but even with full transparency it can be hard for non-specialists to judge their quality. When a market has these characteristics, buyers need to be alert to the danger that bad products will crowd out good ones.\nThere are theoretical reasons why the quality of climate information may deteriorate, but is there evidence of this happening in practice? In 2019, an article in Science suggested that some climate information products might be “…operating outside of the bounds of scientific merit” and, if you work in the field of climate risk, you have probably heard stories of providers pushing precision and granularity beyond what is scientifically plausible. But is there systematic evidence that some climate information has a lemon flavour?\nShortcomings in long-range climate-related predictions might not become apparent for years but there are already indications of problems. Hain et al. recently looked at six different metrics of firm-level exposure to physical climate risks. Three of the measures, from TruCost (part of S\u0026amp;P), Carbon4 Finance and South Pole, were based on the output of climate models, while the other three, from Truvalue Labs (part of FactSet) and two academic groups were constructed by analysing the content of social media, earnings calls and 10-K filings. The correlations between the metrics were generally low, both overall and within specific sectors. Indeed, after allowing for the multiplicity of correlations tested, there were arguably no significant correlations between different metrics. Think about this for a moment: six metrics all claiming to measure the same thing, or at least to be proxies for the same thing, yet they don’t correlate with each other. Even the most generous interpretation implies that most of the metrics contain little information about the common factor they claim to measure. Perhaps one of the metrics is a good measure, but which one? Perhaps none of the metrics are informative. Consider an analogy in which there are six different blood tests to measure the same substance, but when hundreds of subjects are given all six tests there is no correlation between the results. Would a doctor base clinical decisions on any of these tests? Would a medical regulator allow such a situation?\nBy the time the accuracy becomes apparent all those involved are likely to have moved on.\nThe problem of information asymmetry between buyers and sellers might be compounded when the buyers of climate information are not concerned with the accuracy of the information either. Much of the demand for forward-looking climate information is driven by regulators and shareholders expecting firms to disclose their climate-related risks. The exercise is one of “putting numbers in boxes”, and by the time the accuracy of the numbers becomes apparent, all those involved are likely to have moved on. This is not conducive to accurate disclosure.\nAt this point, you might protest that there are many people involved in climate-risk who want to provide accurate and rigorous information that is supported by science, and there are many people who want such information to make accurate disclosures of risk to shareholders. This is true, but it misses the point: the problems in the …","date":1639762865,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639762865,"objectID":"b47330d3229f6a2a063bb2c2dede7c09","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/cost-without-benefit/","publishdate":"2021-12-17T18:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/cost-without-benefit/","section":"post","summary":"The market for forward-looking climate information is structurally vulnerable to bad products pushing out good products.

Calibration means that the frequency of events matches their predicted probabilities while sharpness refers to how often predicted probabilities are close to 0% or 100% for binary forecasts or how narrow the forecast distribution is for a numerical value. Making sharp forecasts is trivial if you don’t care about calibration, so in this blog we will investigate whether forecasts produced by AGORA are calibrated.\nIf I predict a 90% chance of an event occurring and it doesn’t happen then I am not wrong because I allowed for a 10% chance of it not happening. If, however, I repeatedly predict a 90% chance of things occurring and they keep failing to happen you will lose confidence in my ability as a forecaster. This is because my forecasts are not well calibrated. Calibration means the frequency of events matches their predicted probabilities: for example, if you record all the times I said there was a 60% chance of something occurring, that something should have happened 60% of those times.\nFigure 1: An illustration of the percentiles of a predicted probability distribution. If the predicted distribution is well calibrated there is a 5% chance the actual value will fall below the 5th percentile, a 25% chance it will fall below the 25th percentile etc. For well calibrated forecasts of numerical values half the time the actual value should fall below the median (50th percentile) of the predicted distribution and half the time it should fall above it. Similarly, the actual value should fall below the 10th percentile of the predicted distribution in 10 per cent of cases, below the 20th percentile in 20 per cent of cases, and so on. These percentiles are illustrated in Figure 1. If we plot the percentage of forecasts for which the actual value falls below a given percentile of the forecast distribution we should get a diagonal line. Because we have a finite number of forecasts there will be deviations from this line, even if the forecasts are perfectly calibrated, with the size of the deviations shrinking as the number of forecasts used in the analysis increases.\nFigure 2: A calibration plot for 23 AGORA probabilistic at a normalized lead time of 0.75 (after 25% of the time between opening and settlement has elapsed). The grey envelope shows the amount of deviation from the diagonal that can be expected if the 23 forecasts were perfectly calibrated. The plot is consistent with AGORA forecasts being well calibrated. When performing a calibration analysis we need to choose a forecast lead time. If all the forecasts in the analysis are of the same type then this is straightforward: for example, we might want to check the calibration of rainfall forecasts 3 days before the target date. If, however, we are dealing with different types of forecasts, choosing a common lead time might not make sense: Harold Wilson said that, “A week is a long time in politics”, but a week is no time at all in climate prediction. We will express all lead times relative to the duration of the prediction market: A normalized lead time of 0.25 means that a quarter of the time between opening and settlement remains until settlement.\nFigure 2 shows the calibration of 23 AGORA forecasts. The forecasts included in the analysis were all the public markets that have been run on the AGORA platform with cash incentives for participants. This includes predictions of monthly UK temperature, values of an El Niño-Southern Oscillation index and monthly totals of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. The yellow line follows the diagonal with some deviations but the deviations lie within the grey envelope, which indicates how much deviation would occur with 23 perfectly calibrated forecasts.\nFigures 3 and 4 show the calibration plot for normalized lead time of 0.50 and 0.25. The plot for 0.25 suggests the frequency of the actual value falling below the median is only about 30% although this deviation is still consistent with calibrated forecasts due to the relatively small number of forecasts in the analysis.\nFigure 3: As figure 2 but for a normalized lead time of 0.5 Figure 4: As figure 2 but for a normalized lead time of 0.25 “AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated.”\nThese results show the AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated so it is not unreasonable to take the probabilities that AGORA produces at face value. Prescriptions of how to make rational decisions in the face of uncertainty often assume that quantitative probabilities can be assigned to potential outcomes. AGORA prediction markets can be used as a source of these probabilities.\nThis article originally appeared on Medium as How good are AGORA forecasts?\n","date":1606239665,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606239665,"objectID":"ded8662f91fd0de3612931cedef859a7","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/how-good-are-agora-forecasts/","publishdate":"2020-11-24T18:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/how-good-are-agora-forecasts/","section":"post","summary":"AGORA is a prediction market platform that produces forecasts by aggregating the judgments of people taking part in the market.
