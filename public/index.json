According to Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), January 2024 was the warmest on record, pushing the 12-month mean global temperature (Feb 2023 – Jan 2024) to exceed the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average by more than 1.5°C. (See summary here.)\nIn February, the daily Sea Surface Temperature (SST) for 60°S–60°N reached a new absolute record level. The previous highest values were reached on the 23rd and 24th of August 2023.\nFigure 1. Daily sea surface temperature (°C) averaged over the extra-polar global ocean (60°S–60°N) for 2015 (blue), 2016 (yellow), 2023 (red), and 2024 (black line).

According to the latest ENSO update and prediction by NOAA National Weather Service, “transition from El Niño to ENSO-neutral1 is likely by April-June 2024 (79% chance), with increasing odds of La Niña developing in June-August 2024 (55% chance).”\nFigure 2. NOAA Climate Prediction Center Probabilistic El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Outlook (8 Feb 2024). El Niño is declared when SST in the tropical eastern Pacific rise to at least 0.5°C above the long-term average, while La Niña is declared when SST in the tropical eastern Pacific falls to at least 0.5°C below the long-term average. Moreover, these thresholds must be exceeded for a period of at least 5 consecutive overlapping 3-month seasons.\nDuring El Niño there are typically more tropical storms in the tropical Pacific, but fewer in the tropical Atlantic.\nDuring La Niña, the opposite pattern typically holds: there are more tropical storms in the tropical Atlantic than in the tropical Pacific.\nFigure 3. Annual counts of Atlantic Tropical Storms and Hurricanes 1851–2022. Prior to 1950, the detection of storms and hurricanes relied on observation from ships and land. Post-1950, aircraft became much more involved in the detection of storms and hurricanes. Satellite observation was brought online at the end of the 1960s. Post-1970, satellite observation was much more involved in the detection of storms and hurricanes. Hence the comprehensiveness of observation undergoes changes in 1950 and 1970. Data source: NOAA National Hurricane Center The annual counts of Tropical Storms and Hurricanes illustrated in Figure 3 show an increase over the post-1950 period.\nHowever, there is substantial variability. To simplify the visual representation, consider the 10-year Trailing Averages plotted below.\nFigure 4. 10-year Trailing Averages of Atlantic Tropical Storms and Hurricanes 1860–2022. In the post-2000 period the 10-year Trailing Average of Atlantic Tropical Storms rises above and remains above previous highs.\nDuring this period, the 10-year Trailing Average of Atlantic Hurricanes also rises above previous historical highs.\nThese post-2000 highs were achieved along with increased volatility in the annual count, but the volatility is comparable with the volatility of previous peaks in storm and hurricane activity.\nFigure 5. 10-year Trailing Standard Deviation of Atlantic Tropical Storms and Hurricanes 1860–2022. So for Atlantic Storms and Hurricanes, there is a change in mean activity without a substantial increase in volatility over previous records.\nOf the three conjectures introduced at the top, this post-2000 level change doesn’t fit the archetype of #1. an extreme tail event within slowly evolving climatic change.\nThe post-2000 Atlantic storm data could still be consistent with either #2. a mid-tail event within gradually accelerating climatic change or #3. a typical event within rapidly accelerating (tipping-point) climate change.\nEpicurus’ (c. 342–270 BCE) Principle of Multiple Explanations offers guidance here: If more than one theory is consistent with the observations, keep all of these theories.\nCurrent data are consistent with a radical tipping-point explantion, but not exclusively so.\nLike Schrödinger’s cat, we both are and are not at a tipping point in climate change.\n“ENSO-neutral” refers to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) being neither in the (warmer SST) “El Niño” state nor in the (cooler SST) “La Niña” state, whereby the SST in the tropical eastern Pacific falls within +/- 0.5°C of the long-term average. ↩︎\n","date":1707696060,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707696060,"objectID":"1037f2274b5aa13dae045574b89f2093","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/tipping-point/","publishdate":"2024-02-12T00:01:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tipping-point/","section":"post","summary":"Air Temperature, Sea Surface Temperature, and Tropical Storms","tags":["CAHM24"],"title":"Climate Risk at a Tipping Point?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mark Roulston"],"categories":[],"content":" Flood Waters, by Claude Monet. Better information about future climate-related risks is valuable to companies and other organizations, and a new sector of climate service providers has emerged to provide it. Better climate projections might have clear societal benefits but does that make climate analytics an attractive commercial investment?\nClimate analytics, the provision of information about present and future climate risks, is a growing industry. In addition to an increasing number of start ups providing climate services, established consultancies and data vendors are developing their own capabilities, sometimes through acquisitions. Climate change is an important problem and better evaluations of climate risks are undoubtedly of benefit to society, but this does not necessarily make climate analytics an attractive investment. How might the economics of the burgeoning climate analytics sector play out? As with climate change itself, we can think about the future of the sector by considering some different scenarios.\nIn one scenario most long-range climate risk projections end up looking very similar. Many providers base their products on the same publicly available CMIP model runs and then add value by downscaling these simulations to higher resolutions and cross-referencing them with the location of assets and infrastructure. If they use similar downscaling methods, or methods that give similar results, climate risk information will become a commodity and suppliers’ margins will be squeezed.\nAlternatively, the long-range predictions of different providers might be materially different. In this scenario users will be faced with the problem of choosing a provider when they have no way to judge the quality of the predictions. Short-range weather forecasters can be assessed on their track records but this is not practical when horizons are measured in years and decades. This is an example of “asymmetric information” between buyers and sellers. Markets suffering for information asymmetries are vulnerable to failure as buyers will not be prepared to pay for quality they can’t verify and sellers won’t invest in quality they can’t demonstrate.\nAnother possibility is that one or two providers rise to dominance by securing a large share of the market and become de facto standard setters. Their dominance might not be the result of accuracy, because accuracy cannot be ascertained, but because it is easier for people to justify using a product everyone else is using. Strong branding and positive feedback thus create a barrier to entry for other firms.\nThe first two outcomes are not great for investors as providers will struggle to monetize their forecasts. The third scenario, with a dominant provider, is potentially more attractive for investors who back this provider, if they can identify them.\nThe scenarios outlined above are not the only potential outcomes and climate analytic providers may find ways to avoid commodification and solve the information asymmetry problem. Tackling these issues should be an integral part of any climate service provider’s business plan.\nThe original version of this article appeared as Monetizing climate forecasts on LinkedIn.\n","date":1707523201,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707523201,"objectID":"15a02d101c58c52f7c6fbd5bd2c2d7bd","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/monetizing-climate-forecasts/","publishdate":"2024-02-10T00:00:01Z","relpermalink":"/post/monetizing-climate-forecasts/","section":"post","summary":"Better climate projections might have clear societal benefits but does that make climate analytics an attractive commercial investment?","tags":[],"title":"Monetizing Climate Forecasts","type":"post"},{"authors":["Kim Kaivanto"],"categories":[],"content":" The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was record-breaking (at the time) with 28 named storms, 15 hurricanes, four Cat-5 hurricanes, and four major hurricanes making U.S. landfall.

The market will be settled using the number of hurricanes that have occur in the Atlantic between June 1 and November 30, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Centre.\nOnce you have logged into AGORA select the market tab on the left-hand side and select the Atlantic hurricane market.\nFigure 1: The AGORA platform. Select the market tab on the left-hand side and then select the Atlantic hurricane market. The market has 21 outcomes corresponding to no hurricanes, one hurricane, two hurricanes, and so on up to an outcome that covers 20 or more hurricanes. Each outcome has a current price which is set by the automated market maker based on its relative popularity. In December 2024, when the total number of hurricanes is known, the correct outcome will be worth 1.00 credit while all other outcomes will be worth nothing. After the market has been settled you will be eligible to receive £1 for every credit you’ve accumulated above your initial balance. If your final balance is less than your initial balance, you will receive nothing. The prices can interpreted as implied probabilities. If you believe an outcome is more probable than its current price you might consider buying it.\nTo make trading markets with many outcomes more manageable AGORA allows you to create contracts which cover one or more outcomes. Click on Create a new contract to do this.\nFigure 2: When creating a contract just click and select the outcomes you want to include in the contract. This contract just contains the outcome of 8 hurricanes. You can click on the outcomes you want to include in the contract. If you only include a small number of outcomes AGORA will provide a default name listing the outcomes. A contract can’t be created without a name. The contracts you create are private, other participants cannot see them. Once you have created a contract it appears in your inventory, and you can buy some units of the contract from the market maker.\nFigure 3: An order for 100 of the contract “8” has been placed and the market maker is quoting a price of 0.081 per contract. This is slightly higher than the listed price of 0.079 and the difference between quoted and listed prices increases with order size. You can place an order by changing the Quantity column or the Order column. The market maker will quote a price which may differ from the listed price. The difference will be larger for big orders. If the quoted price is acceptable you can click on the Action to accept.\nContracts can cover multiple outcomes. You can click on individual outcomes to add them to a contract, or you can click and hold to include ranges of outcomes.\nFigure 4: A contract covering all outcomes of 9 or more hurricanes. The name `9 or more hurricanes’ has been provided by the user. To sell an outcome just enter a negative number in the Order column or reduce the number in the Quantity column. You cannot “short” a contract, that is you cannot sell a contract that you have not previously bought. Shorting is a strategy used in finance to take advantage of overpricing. However, because on AGORA the outcomes are defined to be mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive (i.e., one and only one outcome must occur) and the prices of outcomes always sum to 1.00 then if you believe any outcome is overpriced then there must be other outcomes that are underpriced.\nAGORA allows you to execute multiple orders simultaneously. If you enter more than one order (buys or sells) the market maker will give you a quote for the entire “basket”.\n","date":1699314065,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699314065,"objectID":"a967df9a225137dc7392d645b5a0795f","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/tutorial-for-cahm24/","publishdate":"2023-11-07T00:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/tutorial-for-cahm24/","section":"post","summary":"The CAHM24 prediction market is intended to produce a forecast of how many hurricanes will occur during the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season that represents the collective wisdom and expertise of all those taking part.","tags":["CAHM24"],"title":"Tutorial for CAHM24","type":"post"},{"authors":["Todd Kaplan"],"categories":null,"content":".\n","date":1695297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695297600,"objectID":"af119d6b911e66855873e53caa9cad7c","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/event/nyuad/","publishdate":"2023-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/nyuad/","section":"event","summary":"In this talk, Todd Kaplan (UoExeter, UoHaifa, CRUCIAL) discusses potential feedback effects in equity markets and prediction markets.","tags":[],"title":"Markets, Information, and Feedback","type":"event"},{"authors":["Kim Kaivanto"],"categories":[],"content":"CRUCIAL at Lancaster University is opening a prediction market to forecast the number of Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 hurricane season.

Deciding how much we should adapt is a trillion-dollar question: Preparing for a worst-case scenario that doesn’t materialize could be as costly as failing to invest enough.\nThe desire to ensure that infrastructure and supply-chains are resilient to climate change has created a demand for more detailed climate forecasts. Climate modelling has historically been done by government-funded agencies, with access to supercomputers, but these are now being joined by a proliferation of private companies, ready to satisfy the need for more granular predictions of climate extremes.\n“Commercial weather forecasters have been a source of innovation…”\nA new industry of “climate analytics” has emerged. The influx of new providers, many backed by venture capital, is welcome. The private sector has provided weather forecasts for many years. Commercial weather forecasters have been a source of innovation and often tailor products to users, such as power companies needing to predict electricity demand. But weather and climate forecasts are different: You can verify weather forecasts after a few days, and in a few months, you’ll know if a forecaster is competent. It can be years, however, or even decades, before the skill of a climate forecaster becomes apparent. When providers are paid upfront for twenty-year forecasts it makes more sense for them to invest in slick marketing than in making their predictions more accurate. George Akerlof won a Nobel Prize for explaining how markets fail when buyers can not evaluate quality. He used the example of low-quality used cars, or “lemons”. Climate forecasting has its own lemon problem, with some products providing precision that cannot be justified, for example. Only sellers of low quality products benefit in this type of market. Consumers and sellers of high quality products lose out.\n“Regulation is more likely to create barriers to entry, and stifle innovation, than to improve forecasts.”\nIf you are deciding where to invest in farmland, or planning a city’s flood defences, there are many climate analytics providers to choose from, but no easy way to distinguish reliable ones from charlatans. One response has, inevitably, been calls for regulation. But climate analytics is a new and fast-developing field. Novel approaches, including machine learning and AI, are being tried in addition to continual improvements to established methods. No regulator has the expertise to decide which techniques will succeed. Regulation is more likely to create barriers to entry, and stifle innovation, than to improve forecasts.\nAn alternative to regulation would be to replace the existing and extemporary marketplace for climate analytics, which rewards marketing prowess, with a deliberately designed market which rewards accuracy. Futures markets settled on climate-related variables, rather than asset prices, would achieve this. The markets would not be for hedging risks but for aggregating the expertise of participants and providing incentives for them to get it right. Markets designed to obtain information, rather than transfer assets or risks, are dubbed “prediction markets”. Their prevailing prices can be interpreted as probabilities of different outcomes — implied forecasts emerging from the collective wisdom of participants.\nIn the absence of hedgers, a climate prediction market would need to be subsidized — we shouldn’t expect to get information for free. There is a case that climate predictions should be a public good so the government could provide some subsidies. Governments are already spending millions of dollars on climate forecasting research and a well-designed market could channel this funding to providers based on performance.\nPrediction markets have been suggested as a tool for policymakers in the past but have failed to catch on. Anti-gambling laws have been an obstacle but so has a lack of subsidies to attract participants to markets on specialized topics. Getting governments to rethink the way they fund climate forecasting is a major challenge, but companies and philanthropists can lead the way. They can pioneer a more efficient and transparent way of distributing money than selecting and contracting with individual providers.\nCompanies, public agencies, and non-profits who want more accurate climate forecasts, as well as providers investing in R\u0026amp;D to make them more accurate, have an interest in fixing the market for climate forecasts. The more accurately we can predict future climate, the more cost effectively we can adapt to it.\nThe original version of this article appeared as Fixing Climate Forecasting’s Lemon Problem\n","date":1684107665,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684107665,"objectID":"2d9452543fb7d7e1c616920c3027ac86","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/fixing-climate-forecastings-lemon-problem/","publishdate":"2023-05-15T00:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/fixing-climate-forecastings-lemon-problem/","section":"post","summary":"The number of private sector suppliers of climate forecasts is growing but knowing whether a provider is competent is hard.

This article is an introduction to trading on AGORA prediction markets. We will cover the mechanics of how you place trades and also offer some tips on how to translate your judgments and opinions into trading strategies.\nIf you have been invited to participate in an AGORA market then you can login to the platform and you will see a screen showing a list of the individual markets open to you (your list will be different to the one below).\nFigure 1: An example of a list of markets available to one participant on AGORA. If you click on the “accounts” icon (the head and shoulders) you will see a list of your accounts with the markets that use that account listed underneath each one. If two markets belong to the same account then credits earned in one market may be used in the other market but credits cannot be transferred from a market under one account to a market under another account.\nFigure 2: A list of one participant’s accounts in AGORA. The markets associated with each account are listed under the account name. Defining Contracts and Placing Trades To trade, you select the “markets” icon (the four panels) and then select a market, e.g. the “Strictly Come Dancing Winner” market. This demonstration market is for predicting the winner of the 2018 series of BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing programme (Americans will know this programme as Dancing with the Stars). In the programme 15 celebrities compete at dancing with one celebrity being ejected from the competition each week. This market is, as the British election commentator Peter Snow might say, “just a bit of fun”, but it illustrates many of the key features of AGORA. This market has 15 distinct outcomes. In all AGORA markets, outcomes are Mutually Exclusive and Comprehensively Exhaustive (MECE): this means that only one outcome can occur but one outcome must occur.\nFigure 3: The market for the winner of the 2018 series of the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing Programme. (This snapshot was taken in the second week of the competition.) The figure above is the market screen for the Strictly market. The number of credits you have in this market space is shown at the top. The current prices for each outcome are shown in the bar graph. The favourite is Joe Sugg with a price of 0.132. This price can be interpreted as the probability of Joe Sugg winning. AGORA allows you to define contracts that cover one or more outcomes. You can then buy one or more of the contracts you define. At settlement you will receive 1.00 credit for each contract you hold that covers the outcome that actually occurs.\nTo define a contract click on the “+” icon, then click on one or more outcomes that you want covered by the contract.\nFigure 4: Defining a contract that will pay out 1.00 credit if Joe Sugg wins. The simplest type of contract covers a single outcome. For example, the figure above shows a contract that covers Joe Sugg winning. AGORA has automatically named this contract “Joe Sugg” but you are free to rename the contract if you want. Contract definitions are specific to you — other participants do not see your contracts and must define their own. If you click “create” the Joe Sugg contract is created.\nContracts can cover more than one outcome. For example, you can create a contract covering all the female contestants and name the contract “Female Winner”.\nFigure 5: Defining a contract that will pay out 1.00 credit a female wins. Figure 6: Portfolio of defined contracts. Your portfolio is shown below the price bar chart. AGORA uses a market maker that will always quote a price for a contract. These prices are shown in the PRICE column. The QUANTITY column shows how many units of each contract you currently hold. To buy contracts you can either specify the number you wish to have in the QUANTITY field or you can specify a change in your inventory in the ORDER field. Although you have defined two contracts you have not yet bought any so you can delete the definitions.\nFigure 7: You can buy contracts by either specifying the quantity you want to have in your inventory or specifying an order (change in inventory). In the figure above, an order to buy 100 of the Joe Sugg contract has been placed and the market maker is quoting a price of 0.138 per contract. This is slightly higher than the 0.132 in the PRICE column because the market maker raises the price a bit in response to the buy order.\nFigure 8: You can sell contracts by placing a negative order. Going Long and Going Short Since a contract pays out 1.00 credit if an outcome covered by the contract occurs it follows that the expected value of the contract is the probability that the outcome occurs. If you think that the probability of a contract paying out is substantially higher than the quoted price then you have a reason to buy the contract, or “go long” in the parlance of financial …","date":1664581265,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664581265,"objectID":"8e3aa73a9a83ab498df4d31e492fa6a2","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/beginners-guide-to-trading-on-agora-prediction-markets/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/beginners-guide-to-trading-on-agora-prediction-markets/","section":"post","summary":"AGORA is a platform for hosting prediction markets in which participants can bet on the outcome of events or the values of particular quantities.

Figure: Odds ratios across 29 teams. Figure: OR point estimates clustered by analytic approach. The observed results from analyzing a complex data set can be highly contingent on justifiable, but subjective, analytic decisions.

An outcome of interest – such as average CO2 concentration in the year 2040, for example – is partitioned into intervals. Expert participants compare the results of their own modelling with the prices of these intervals, and purchase or sell claims on these intervals if their model suggests the price is too low or too high.\nWith a well-designed market such as Lancaster University’s AGORA prediction-market platform, the price of a contract can be interpreted as the market-based probability of the event happening.\nThese kinds of long-range markets have not been established to date due, in part, to regulatory obstacles. However, the researchers believe the markets can be designed to overcome these obstacles by avoiding the ‘pay-to-play’ aspect of existing prediction markets in which the losses of less-well-informed individuals fund the winnings of better-informed individuals. Instead, markets can be structured as vehicles for distributing research funding to experts and modellers in a manner that is consistent with the principles of effective altruism: an initial stake provided by a sponsor is distributed to participants in accordance with the quality and quantity of information they bring into the market through their trading activity.\nThey add that access to participation in the markets would need to have selection criteria to ensure diversity of views and a range of expertise to ensure they are able to aggregate diverse sources of information.\nThe paper’s authors are Kim Kaivanto of Lancaster University, and Mark Roulston, Todd Kaplan and Brett Day of the University of Exeter.\nThe original version of this article appeared as How ‘prediction markets’ could improve climate risk policies and investment decisions\n","date":1661989265,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661989265,"objectID":"c801699e7b66c2dc01d3a0224d8a5eca","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/prediction-markets-improve-policies-decisions/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/prediction-markets-improve-policies-decisions/","section":"post","summary":"A market-led approach could be key to guiding policy, research and business decisions about future climate risks, a new study outlines.\nPublished today in the journal Nature Climate Change, the paper from academics at the Universities of Lancaster and Exeter details how expert ‘prediction markets’ could improve the climate-risk forecasts that guide key business and regulatory decisions.","tags":[],"title":"How 'prediction markets' could improve climate risk policies and investment decisions","type":"post"},{"authors":["Mark Roulston","Todd Kaplan","Brett Day","and Kim Kaivanto"],"categories":["CO2","Prediction markets"],"content":"","date":1661986886,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661986886,"objectID":"d2bda577a05d7bf5e838fc9960fe7eb6","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/publication/prediction-market-innovations-can-improve-climate-risk-forecasts/","publishdate":"2022-09-04T18:38:26+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/prediction-market-innovations-can-improve-climate-risk-forecasts/","section":"publication","summary":"Forward-looking information about climate risks is critical for decision makers, but the provision and accuracy of such information is limited.

Information markets use market-like mechanisms to elicit and aggregate information. Information markets are not designed to transfer ownership or risk but to exploit the proven ability of markets to discover and synthesize information. Information markets can solve the problems of aggregating diverse climate expertise and aligning the incentives of providers. They could become the primary mechanism for obtaining forward-looking expertise about climate-related risks.\nWhy? Climate change is recognised as an important source of risk. Regulators now believe that climate-related risks pose, not only a threat to individual firms, but possibly to the stability of the financial system. In 2017 the G20’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) published recommendations that firms should disclose forward-looking information about physical and transition climate-related risks. More than two thousand companies have voluntarily signed-up to these recommendations. Regulators and exchanges in many countries plan to make climate-related disclosures mandatory. These trends have created a demand for forward-looking information about climate, such as emissions pathways and changes in physical climate risks. Companies requiring this information are a nascent source of funding for applied climate research. They are particularly interested in the efficiency with which distributed information can be aggregated and communicated for use in decision making and risk management. The marketplace for climate information is diverse and fragmented. Relevant expertise exists in public agencies, academia, think tanks, as well as an emerging class of private companies known as climate service providers (CSPs). Given the long horizons involved, few providers have established track records, so it is difficult for users to evaluate their skill. Furthermore, most forecasts are offered with no warranty. This creates a situation in which bad forecasts can drive out good ones; a situation reminiscent of credit ratings for mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the subprime crisis.\nHow? We propose a climate information exchange that hosts markets predicting climate-related variables. These variables will include high-level ones, such as global greenhouse gas concentrations, and more granular ones like sea-level rise in specific locations. Market participants will include individuals and institutions with expertise across the range of disciplines relevant to climate forecasting, including meteorology, climatology, economics, social sciences, and policy. Participants will use on-platform credits representing a claim on a proportion of research funds distributed through the exchange. These funds will come from public, private, and philanthropic sources interested in effective altruism. The exchange will use AGORA, developed by Hivemind Technologies Ltd. AGORA has been used to run expert information markets for seasonal forecasts, El Niño events, Atlantic hurricane activity, and crop yields. AGORA solves several problems that have afflicted previous attempts to create information markets for climate: an automated market maker guarantees liquidity allowing markets to function in the absence of uninformed “noise” traders. AGORA supports very large outcome spaces, enabling consensus probability distributions to be extracted, not just probabilities for binary events.\nWhere? Many of the markets will have horizons of more than a decade. The consensus forecasts generated will be a public good, to be distributed for free. There is a strong case for the exchange to be hosted by a university, which will become a hub for international climate expertise.\n","date":1656630086,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656630086,"objectID":"266f8a4337e55c6b553ff42ffc5a1d30","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/publication/crucial-white-paper/","publishdate":"2022-09-04T18:38:26+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/crucial-white-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"A proposal for generating forward-looking climate-risk information with expert prediction markets.","tags":["greenhouse gas emissions","temperature anomaly","prediction markets","climate risk","climate change","adverse incentives","methdologocial choice","multi-disciplinarity","circularity problem","data gaps"],"title":"CRUCIAL White Paper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Roulston"],"categories":[],"content":"The market for climate risk forecasts suffers from a problem economists call “asymmetric information”: the sellers of forecasts probably know more about their accuracy than the buyers. A short or medium range weather forecast can be verified in a couple of weeks, and reasonable statistics about their accuracy can be accumulated in a matter of months but, because a climate forecast might not verify for years or decades, buyers cannot usually use a forecaster’s track record to assess their accuracy. A market in which the quality of a product won’t be apparent for years is susceptible to “adverse selection”, which is economists’ way of saying it will be a magnet for charlatans. This creates a challenge for providers of climate forecasts who are competent and have invested in research and development to improve the accuracy: how can they persuade buyers that they are not charlatans?\n“Talk is cheap.”\nClimate service providers can emphasise their credentials and highlight the scientific effort that goes into their products; they might allow users to see how their models work — although many users don’t have the expertise to assess the models, and if the seller uses proprietary models this might not be option anyway. The problem with these solutions is that “talk is cheap”, and it is difficult for a buyer to distinguish authentic expertise from slick marketing.\nThe economist George Akerlof, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on information asymmetries, explained the problem in a classic paper published in 1970 which described the market for used cars. As with climate forecasts, it is difficult for the buyer of a used car to know its quality and, also like climate forecasts, a car is an infrequent purchase so there is little opportunity to accumulate much first-hand knowledge about the reliability of a seller. These attributes made the market for used cars attractive to less-than-reputable characters, creating the stereotype of the untrustworthy used-car dealer.\n“Dealers offered warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors.”\nThe reputation of used-car dealers has improved since the 1970s, partly because the sector adopted one of the strategies for dealing with asymmetric information described by Akerlof: offering cash back warranties. In the U.K. used-car warranties became mandatory in 2015, but even before then, dealers offered warranties to differentiate themselves from competitors and enable them to charge higher prices.\nA promise of a refund if a product fails can serve two distinct purposes: indemnifying the buyer for losses caused by the failure and providing a credible signal that the seller believes failure is unlikely. An inaccurate climate forecast may cause the user a loss far above the price they paid for the forecast: for example, they may build sea defences that are too low, or too high. While a forecast provider might not be able to indemnify the user against all costs, they can still offer a refund to signal their confidence in the accuracy of the forecast. The credibility of the signal is determined, not by whether the refund will compensate the user, but whether it will be painful for the provider.\nClimate forecasts, generally, are not categorically right or wrong: they are probabilistic forecasts — or they should be — in which probabilities are assigned to specified outcomes. How could the terms of a refund be structured for this type of product? There is a literature on this subject going back 70 years, when Glenn Brier introduced a quadratic scoring rule for assessing probability forecasts and I.J. Good suggested the logarithmic scoring rule as a way to reward forecasters. Since then more work has been done on the concept of “proper scoring rules” for incentivizing forecasters. More recently, proper scoring rules have been suggested as the basis for incentives that screen the views of informed and uninformed experts when only a single forecast is being made. There are subtleties to be appreciated, and pitfalls to avoid, but in principle a proper scoring rule could be used to evaluate the quality of a probabilistic forecast and determine the refund to which the buyer is entitled. This can only be done when the actual outcome becomes known, which in some cases may be more than twenty years after the forecast is made. Some people might think that providing a warranty on a timescale of decades is unrealistic but other industries do it: e.g., 10-year structural warranties for new houses or the lifetime warranties offered by high-end manufacturers that can be claimed decades after a product is purchased. It is also analogous to deferring bonuses in the finance industry. Climate service providers unwilling to expose themselves to some risk on climatic timescales are arguably in the wrong business.\n“A well-structured warranty can be used to communicate how much confidence a forecast provider has.”\nThe information asymmetry in the market for climate forecasts is at least as bad as the one for …","date":1646934065,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646934065,"objectID":"e0c9090f38ec3b222a2e0339795b6068","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/why-no-climate-warranties/","publishdate":"2022-03-10T18:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/why-no-climate-warranties/","section":"post","summary":"The market for climate risk forecasts suffers from information asymmetries which could be mitigated by warranties from forecast providers.

These included Aviva, Gallagher Re, Axa XL, BNP Paribas, Premetrica, Economics for the Environment Consultancy, National Bank of Belgium, Weather Logistics Ltd., Global Assoc Risk Professionals, Insight Investment, APG Asset Management, Jupiter Intelligence, Federated Hermes, and Smarkets.\nDr Kaivanto said: “Many planning and investment decisions require an understanding of how future climate change will manifest itself. There are many sources of information and expertise, but decision-makers face significant difficulties in accessing, interpreting, and appraising it.\n“This workshop provided the opportunity for academia and finance professionals to discuss how we can establish a UK-based prediction market exchange that will seek to deliver robust and publicly available climate forecasts. It could serve as a mechanism to fund research that targets the highest priority climate risks of sponsoring institutions in an incentive compatible way for providers.”\nIn his presentation at Woburn House, Dr Kaivanto outlined structural issues with the climate risk information and forecast markets, including how the decadal “discovery times” required to ascertain the accuracy of climate forecasts creates an information asymmetry in which providers are likely to know more about the quality of the forecasts than users. This asymmetry makes the market vulnerable to adverse selection in which low-quality forecasts drive out higher-quality forecasts.\nHe also discussed the potential risks of relying on single models and providers for climate risk assessment, and the circularity problem in climate prediction, and how it might be solved by allowing forecasters to make predictions of climate conditioned on greenhouse gas concentrations, which is possible using two-dimensional, joint-outcome markets (e.g. CO2 concentration and global temperature anomaly).\nThe session concluded that participants in prediction markets should be seen as sources of information who are rewarded for impounding their information into prediction market prices, not as sources of revenue for the market maker, or for better-informed or quicker market participants. Selection of participants – potentially restricted to individuals or organisations (academic, private sector or NGOs) – would allow for a diverse and credible pool of expertise, adding to the credibility of the markets.\nParticipants also concluded that the information the markets would generate would have the attributes of a ‘public good’: non-rival and non-excludable, with funding typically from governments, philanthropic foundations, or consortia of end-users – the latter of whom could limit access to the information, for more of a ‘club good’.\nThis report on the workshop originally appeared here.\n","date":1644328800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644328800,"objectID":"4e1bd5b69799a967d079db5700c50555","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/event/woburn-house/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/woburn-house/","section":"event","summary":"A workshop about an initiative to address emerging problems with the provision of climate risk information. 8 Feb 2022, Woburn House, London","tags":[],"title":"Prediction Markets for Climate Risk","type":"event"},{"authors":["Mark Roulston"],"categories":[],"content":"In 1970, the economist George Akerlof published what would become a classic paper called, “The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and Market Mechanisms.” The “lemons” he was referring to were low-quality used cars. His insight was that, in markets where buyers cannot evaluate products, they will not pay a premium for purported high quality. This, in turn, will give sellers little incentive to provide high quality products. Consequently, the average quality of products in the market declines, further reducing the amount buyers are willing to pay. In economics jargon an “information asymmetry” between buyers and sellers results in “adverse selection”. The process identified by Akerlof is now a textbook example of market failure.\nA buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them.\nThe used car market is not the only one susceptible to the “lemon” problem. (Ironically, in the market for actual lemons, buyers can easily assess freshness and taste). A rapidly growing market that is also vulnerable is the one for information about long-range climate risks. A buyer of short-range weather forecasts does not need to know about meteorology to evaluate them. They just need to know some statistics and be able to collect a sufficiently large sample of forecasts and subsequent outcomes to estimate the skill of the provider. For forecasts 1–2 days ahead, this sample might be obtained in a matter of months. However, companies increasingly need forecasts of climate-related risks on horizons of years, and even decades. Obviously, on these time scales, waiting to see how forecasts turn out before choosing a provider is not practical. Some providers want to keep their models and methods proprietary, but even with full transparency it can be hard for non-specialists to judge their quality. When a market has these characteristics, buyers need to be alert to the danger that bad products will crowd out good ones.\nThere are theoretical reasons why the quality of climate information may deteriorate, but is there evidence of this happening in practice? In 2019, an article in Science suggested that some climate information products might be “…operating outside of the bounds of scientific merit” and, if you work in the field of climate risk, you have probably heard stories of providers pushing precision and granularity beyond what is scientifically plausible. But is there systematic evidence that some climate information has a lemon flavour?\nShortcomings in long-range climate-related predictions might not become apparent for years but there are already indications of problems. Hain et al. recently looked at six different metrics of firm-level exposure to physical climate risks. Three of the measures, from TruCost (part of S\u0026amp;P), Carbon4 Finance and South Pole, were based on the output of climate models, while the other three, from Truvalue Labs (part of FactSet) and two academic groups were constructed by analysing the content of social media, earnings calls and 10-K filings. The correlations between the metrics were generally low, both overall and within specific sectors. Indeed, after allowing for the multiplicity of correlations tested, there were arguably no significant correlations between different metrics. Think about this for a moment: six metrics all claiming to measure the same thing, or at least to be proxies for the same thing, yet they don’t correlate with each other. Even the most generous interpretation implies that most of the metrics contain little information about the common factor they claim to measure. Perhaps one of the metrics is a good measure, but which one? Perhaps none of the metrics are informative. Consider an analogy in which there are six different blood tests to measure the same substance, but when hundreds of subjects are given all six tests there is no correlation between the results. Would a doctor base clinical decisions on any of these tests? Would a medical regulator allow such a situation?\nBy the time the accuracy becomes apparent all those involved are likely to have moved on.\nThe problem of information asymmetry between buyers and sellers might be compounded when the buyers of climate information are not concerned with the accuracy of the information either. Much of the demand for forward-looking climate information is driven by regulators and shareholders expecting firms to disclose their climate-related risks. The exercise is one of “putting numbers in boxes”, and by the time the accuracy of the numbers becomes apparent, all those involved are likely to have moved on. This is not conducive to accurate disclosure.\nAt this point, you might protest that there are many people involved in climate-risk who want to provide accurate and rigorous information that is supported by science, and there are many people who want such information to make accurate disclosures of risk to shareholders. This is true, but it misses the point: the problems in the …","date":1639762865,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639762865,"objectID":"b47330d3229f6a2a063bb2c2dede7c09","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/cost-without-benefit/","publishdate":"2021-12-17T18:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/cost-without-benefit/","section":"post","summary":"The market for forward-looking climate information is structurally vulnerable to bad products pushing out good products.

On November 30 the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season came to an end and Hivemind settled prediction markets forecasting how many hurricanes there would be and how many would make landfall over the U.S.\nThe 2020 hurricane season was one of the most active ever seen. There were 30 named storms, beating the 2005 record of 28. Of the 30 storms, 13 achieved hurricane strength and 6 of those made landfall over the U.S., with a further 4 making landfall over Central America.\nAs part of its participation in the Fifth Cohort of the Lloyd’s Lab InsurTech accelerator, Hivemind ran hurricane prediction markets on its AGORA prediction market platform. Twenty experts in meteorology and statistical climatology from academia and the private sector took part. The market opened in August when the season was underway and three hurricanes had already occurred. Forecasts from groups at Colorado State University and Tropical Storm Risk were for an active season with 12 and 10 hurricanes respectively. This information was immediately priced into the market, with the expected number of hurricanes jumping from the climatological average of 6 to around 10 on opening.\nAs the season progressed the market expectation fluctuated in response to the formation of new storms — increasing to 12 when three hurricanes formed in the space of a week and falling back during a two week period with no hurricanes. It rose again as a succession of storms formed that meant, as in 2005, the National Hurricane Centre exhausted their alphabetized storm names and had to resort to Greek letters.\nHailiang Du, Assistant Professor of Statistics at Durham University, finished top in the market for the total number of hurricanes. “I usually looked at NOAA 5-day and 2-day outlooks, sometimes also European model runs as well as Canadian models,” explained Professor Du, “I tried to aggregate the model information together to form my own forecast probability distribution.”\nThe AGORA hurricane prediction markets demonstrate how prediction markets assimilate new information as it becomes available. Unlike surveys, which provide a snapshot of views at a point in time, prediction markets allow participants to update their positions in real time.\nAGORA prediction markets could be used to generate pre-season forecasts of hurricane activity.

Making sharp forecasts is trivial if you don’t care about calibration, so in this blog we will investigate whether forecasts produced by AGORA are calibrated.\nIf I predict a 90% chance of an event occurring and it doesn’t happen then I am not wrong because I allowed for a 10% chance of it not happening. If, however, I repeatedly predict a 90% chance of things occurring and they keep failing to happen you will lose confidence in my ability as a forecaster. This is because my forecasts are not well calibrated. Calibration means the frequency of events matches their predicted probabilities: for example, if you record all the times I said there was a 60% chance of something occurring, that something should have happened 60% of those times.\nFigure 1: An illustration of the percentiles of a predicted probability distribution. If the predicted distribution is well calibrated there is a 5% chance the actual value will fall below the 5th percentile, a 25% chance it will fall below the 25th percentile etc. For well calibrated forecasts of numerical values half the time the actual value should fall below the median (50th percentile) of the predicted distribution and half the time it should fall above it. Similarly, the actual value should fall below the 10th percentile of the predicted distribution in 10 per cent of cases, below the 20th percentile in 20 per cent of cases, and so on. These percentiles are illustrated in Figure 1. If we plot the percentage of forecasts for which the actual value falls below a given percentile of the forecast distribution we should get a diagonal line. Because we have a finite number of forecasts there will be deviations from this line, even if the forecasts are perfectly calibrated, with the size of the deviations shrinking as the number of forecasts used in the analysis increases.\nFigure 2: A calibration plot for 23 AGORA probabilistic at a normalized lead time of 0.75 (after 25% of the time between opening and settlement has elapsed). The grey envelope shows the amount of deviation from the diagonal that can be expected if the 23 forecasts were perfectly calibrated. The plot is consistent with AGORA forecasts being well calibrated. When performing a calibration analysis we need to choose a forecast lead time. If all the forecasts in the analysis are of the same type then this is straightforward: for example, we might want to check the calibration of rainfall forecasts 3 days before the target date. If, however, we are dealing with different types of forecasts, choosing a common lead time might not make sense: Harold Wilson said that, “A week is a long time in politics”, but a week is no time at all in climate prediction. We will express all lead times relative to the duration of the prediction market: A normalized lead time of 0.25 means that a quarter of the time between opening and settlement remains until settlement.\nFigure 2 shows the calibration of 23 AGORA forecasts. The forecasts included in the analysis were all the public markets that have been run on the AGORA platform with cash incentives for participants. This includes predictions of monthly UK temperature, values of an El Niño-Southern Oscillation index and monthly totals of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. The yellow line follows the diagonal with some deviations but the deviations lie within the grey envelope, which indicates how much deviation would occur with 23 perfectly calibrated forecasts.\nFigures 3 and 4 show the calibration plot for normalized lead time of 0.50 and 0.25. The plot for 0.25 suggests the frequency of the actual value falling below the median is only about 30% although this deviation is still consistent with calibrated forecasts due to the relatively small number of forecasts in the analysis.\nFigure 3: As figure 2 but for a normalized lead time of 0.5 Figure 4: As figure 2 but for a normalized lead time of 0.25 “AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated.”\nThese results show the AGORA forecasts are consistent with being well calibrated so it is not unreasonable to take the probabilities that AGORA produces at face value. Prescriptions of how to make rational decisions in the face of uncertainty often assume that quantitative probabilities can be assigned to potential outcomes. AGORA prediction markets can be used as a source of these probabilities.\nThis article originally appeared on Medium as How good are AGORA forecasts?\n","date":1606239665,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606239665,"objectID":"ded8662f91fd0de3612931cedef859a7","permalink":"https://www.crucialab.net/post/how-good-are-agora-forecasts/","publishdate":"2020-11-24T18:41:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/how-good-are-agora-forecasts/","section":"post","summary":"AGORA is a prediction market platform that produces forecasts by aggregating the judgments of people taking part in the market.
